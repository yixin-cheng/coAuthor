What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me.

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Y",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem.

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

It's difficult to explain what makes me cringe in a fictional character. It's a combination of the portrayal and the circumstances.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

It's difficult to explain what makes me cringe in a fictional character. It's a combination of the portrayal and the circumstances. The portrayal of Al Bundy will never change, because the show ended a long time ago. The circumstances have changed because, with age and experience, I've learned to approach life with more empathy.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.

I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

It's difficult to explain what makes me cringe in a fictional character. It's a combination of the portrayal and the circumstances. The portrayal of Al Bundy will never change, because the show ended a long time ago. The circumstances have changed because, with age and experience, I've learned to approach life with more empathy.

 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me.
