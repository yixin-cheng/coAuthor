 anyways, because all are necessary when needed. If you get a nasty cut on your arm at school, they send you to the nurses office to help you cover the wound so you are not getting blood everywhere.  Toilet paper,  well obviously they must provide that. Just like soap, and the others, pads and tampons are needed sometimes for all students, not just the poor ones.

As far as period shaming, yes the school should step in the best it could and try to help those students that are being bullied. Try to make everyone understand that a period is something that every single girl in the world has to deal with, and that it is just part of evolution and growing up. That there is nothing that can be done to stop it, no matter how hard anyone tries.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

As far as period shaming, yes the school should step in the best it could and try to help those students that are being bullied. Try to make everyone understand that a period is something that every single girl in the world has to deal with, and that it is just part of evolution and growing up.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes schools should provide pads and tampons to school but only to those students that need them while they are at school. I think that schools should provide pads and tampons to students because it is a necessity just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other toiletries of the like. 

As I am a guy, I have not ever experienced period shaming or period poverty, nor have I ever done those kinds of things to a person ever. Schools should somewhat step in there because it mostly happens on their grounds, kind of making their responsibility to address such issues.
I think that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
 anyways, because all are necessary when needed. If you get a nasty cut on your arm at school, they send you to the nurses office to help you cover the wound so you are not getting blood everywhere.  Toilet paper,  well obviously they must provide that. Just like soap, and the others, pads and tampons are needed sometimes for all students, not just the poor ones.

As far as period shaming, yes the school should step in the best it could and try to help those students that are being bullied. Try to make everyone understand that a period is something that every single girl in the world has to deal with, and that it is just part of evolution and growing up. That there is nothing that can be done to stop it, no matter how hard anyone tries.

In my opinion, yes schools should provide pads and tampons to school but only to those students that need them while they are at school. I think that schools should provide pads and tampons to students because it is a necessity just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other toiletries of the like. 

As I am a guy, I have not ever experienced period shaming or period poverty, nor have I ever done those kinds of things to a person ever. Schools should somewhat step in there because it mostly happens on their grounds, kind of making their responsibility to address such issues.

 anyways, because all are necessary when needed. If you get a nasty cut on your arm at school, they send you to the nurses office to help you cover the wound so you are not getting blood everywhere.  Toilet paper,  well obviously they must provide that. Just like soap, and the others, pads and tampons are needed sometimes for all students, not just the poor ones.

As far as period shaming, yes the school should step in the best it could and try to help those students that are being bullied. Try to make everyone understand that a period is something that every single girl in the world has to deal with, and that it is just part of evolution and growing up. That there is nothing that can be done to stop it, no matter how hard anyone tries.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?
