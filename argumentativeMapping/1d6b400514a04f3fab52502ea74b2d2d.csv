We has an information crisis in our country/world right now. There is so much information out there that it is hard to know what to believe. The algorithms that feed us news just reinforce what we already believe since we are less likely  to read conflicting information. We are more likely to keep reading about what we already think and believe and then those beliefs just get stronger and stronger. We have come to a point where we can not agree on much anymore and it is tearing us apart. We need to be able to agree on some basic facts and then we can have a conversation about how we should move forward.
