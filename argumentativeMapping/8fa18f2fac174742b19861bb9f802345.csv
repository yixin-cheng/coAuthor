An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.

In my opinion, what makes a character portrayal offensive is its unreality. And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.

And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, what makes a character portrayal offensive is its unreality. And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.
I think that's the key to a good portrayal of a character:
 you may like or hate them, but you care.

A contrary example is the protagonist of the fiction book ""The Good Lawyer"" by Thomas Benigno. The book is masterfully plotted, but the main character is a  cipher. I didn't relate to him and didn't care what happened to him. He could have been anyone. The book suffered and so did the reader.
