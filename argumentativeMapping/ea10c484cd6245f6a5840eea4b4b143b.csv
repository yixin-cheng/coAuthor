In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's e",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook.

I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace.

But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head.

When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration.

So much of the media we consume is static and pre-recorded: videos, music, movies, TV shows and the like.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on the environment around you at the time. For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

But environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine a voice of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

So much of the media we consume is static and pre-recorded: videos, music, movies, TV shows and the like. None allow the consumer to enter into a process of co-creation with the author like reading does. When I watch a movie I am distant, but reading is an act of intimacy in which the reader and author engage. 

The good reader, it is said, reads with a pen in hand. Reading demand attention and engagement in a way that audiobooks never do.

So much of the media we consume is static and pre-recorded: videos, music, movies, TV shows and the like. None allow the consumer to enter into a process of co-creation with the author like reading does.

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on your environment.  For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

Environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening requires active attention and forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine the soun of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

So much of the media we consume is static and pre-recorded: videos, music, movies, TV shows and the like. None allow the consumer to enter into a process of co-creation with the author like reading does. When I watch a movie I am distant, but reading is an act of intimacy in which the reader and author engage. 

The good reader, it is said, reads with a pen in hand. Reading demand attention and engagement in a way that audiobooks never do.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on your environment.  For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.
