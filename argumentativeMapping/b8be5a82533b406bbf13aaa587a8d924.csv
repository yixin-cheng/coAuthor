In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs.

These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys.

These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition",user,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable.

In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to provide for hygiene products for themselves. We need to encourage them to develop the habit of bringing their own sanitary pads or tampons into school. This is good",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to provide for hygiene products for themselves. We need to encourage them to develop the habit of bringing their own sanitary pads or tampons into school. This is good for them in any occasions",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to provide for hygiene products for themselves. We need to encourage them to develop the habit of bringing their own sanitary pads or tampons into school.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to provide for hygiene products for themselves.

In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to provide for hygiene products for themselves. We need to encourage them to develop the habit of bringing their own sanitary pads or tampons into school. This is good for them in any occasions in their life time.

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to provide for hygiene products for themselves. We need to encourage them to develop the habit of bringing their own sanitary pads or tampons into school. This is good for them in any occasions in their life time.
