In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever.

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government.

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks.

I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks.

Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community.

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community.

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health.

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community.

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community.

A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government.

News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to.

In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community.

I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, even if you don't keep up with the n",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, even if you don't keep up with the news.

News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, even if you don't keep up with the news.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, even if you don't keep up with the news.

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, even if you don't keep up with the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?
