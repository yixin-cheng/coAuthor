In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For ex",user,22,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now.

You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfis",user,26,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish. I know many people would disagree with me when they hear about someone accidentally dying while trying to do a stunt. It just comes down to",user,28,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish.
