In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general.

Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging.

Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging.

Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people.

People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that o",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk.

People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful.

People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk.

People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests.",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to",user,29,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Mos",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the ap",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of.

However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. The app",user,31,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful.

We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the abi",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests.

Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates.

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people.

These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others. `!",user,32,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.

However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others. This is something that not everyone knows how to do, but once it is learned, it leads to new social connections with people, which can lead to a happier life.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging.

Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others. This is something that not everyone knows how to do, but once it is learned, it leads to new social connections with people, which can lead to a happier life.

However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others.

Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others.

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people.
