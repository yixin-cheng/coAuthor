In my opinion, we aren't being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think that is a personal choice that we make and that doesn't dictate whether we are good or bad citizens.

News is also a very broad term. Some people follow political news. Some people follow sports news. I assume this topic relates to world news or local news and again I think that's a personal choice. 

I personally don't think the news is that valuable. Obviously there are certain times that you have to tune in such as a global pandemic like the Coronavirus. That type of news is essential to basically everyone in the country. We need to be up to date with that news because it can affect us and everyone around us in a negative way.

I think that hearing stories about murder, robbery and things like that can put us in a negative mind space. That is why I try to avoid the news at all costs. When I hear something upsetting it usually makes me sad. If I avoid the news, I don't get sad as much because I don't hear or see as much upsetting information.

Engaging in current events can be impactful depending on the person and the event. For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news. Most of the time the local news is highlighting sad stories and the national news is always filled with propaganda and false information on both sides.

In my opinion, we aren't being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think that is a personal choice that we make and that doesn't dictate whether we are good or bad citizens.

News is also a very broad term. Some people follow political news. Some people follow sports news. I assume this topic relates to world news or local news and again I think that's a personal choice. 

I personally don't think the news is that valuable. Obviously there are certain times that you have to tune in such as a global pandemic like the Coronavirus. That type of news is essential to basically everyone in the country. We need to be up to date with that news because it can affect us and everyone around us in a negative way.

I think that hearing stories about murder, robbery and things like that can put us in a negative mind space. That is why I try to avoid the news at all costs. When I hear something upsetting it usually makes me sad. If I avoid the news, I don't get sad as much because I don't hear or see as much upsetting information.

Engaging in current events can be impactful depending on the person and the event. For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news. Most of the time the local news is highlighting sad stories and the national news is always filled with propaganda and false information on both sides.

For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news.

In my opinion, we aren't being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think that is a personal choice that we make and that doesn't dictate whether we are good or bad citizens.

News is also a very broad term. Some people follow political news. Some people follow sports news. I assume this topic relates to world news or local news and again I think that's a personal choice. 

I personally don't think the news is that valuable. Obviously there are certain times that you have to tune in such as a global pandemic like the Coronavirus. That type of news is essential to basically everyone in the country. We need to be up to date with that news because it can affect us and everyone around us in a negative way.

I think that hearing stories about murder, robbery and things like that can put us in a negative mind space. That is why I try to avoid the news at all costs. When I hear something upsetting it usually makes me sad. If I avoid the news, I don't get sad as much because I don't hear or see as much upsetting information.

Engaging in current events can be impactful depending on the person and the event. For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news. Most of the time the local news is highlighting sad stories and the national news is always filled with propaganda and false information on both sides.

In my opinion, we aren't being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think that is a personal choice that we make and that doesn't dictate whether we are good or bad citizens.

News is also a very broad term. Some people follow political news. Some people follow sports news. I assume this topic relates to world news or local news and again I think that's a personal choice. 

I personally don't think the news is that valuable. Obviously there are certain times that you have to tune in such as a global pandemic like the Coronavirus. That type of news is essential to basically everyone in the country. We need to be up to date with that news because it can affect us and everyone around us in a negative way.

I think that hearing stories about murder, robbery and things like that can put us in a negative mind space. That is why I try to avoid the news at all costs. When I hear something upsetting it usually makes me sad. If I avoid the news, I don't get sad as much because I don't hear or see as much upsetting information.

Engaging in current events can be impactful depending on the person and the event. For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news. Most of the time the local news is highlighting sad stories and the national news is always filled with propaganda and false information on both sides.

I think this way because over time the news has just turned me off and never made me want to watch it again. I hate the news. If something is very important I'll see it on social media or a family member will tell me about it.
