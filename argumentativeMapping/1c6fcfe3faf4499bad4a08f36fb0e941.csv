What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller.

Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do.

Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It j",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch. 

So yes, a stereotypical character

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch. 

So yes, a stereotypical character can make me cringe. At the same time, I am guilty of enjoy

Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut.

Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch. 

So yes, a stereotypical character can make me cringe. At the same time, I am guilty of enjoying certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano and Walter White. Hope

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch. 

So yes, a stereotypical character can make me cringe. At the same time, I am guilty of enjoying certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano and Walter White. Hopefully in the future there are more characters like Tony Soprano and Walter White whe

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch.

Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch. 

So yes, a stereotypical character can make me cringe. At the same time, I am guilty of enjoying certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano and Walter White. Hopefully in the future there are more characters like Tony Soprano and Walter White where the stereotype isn't thought about, and less characters like the dumb blonde where the stereotype is the entire personality of the char
