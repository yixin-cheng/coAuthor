In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.

As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other.

 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

I’m sure the next pandemic we face will be in some way digitally transmitted. Maybe it already has.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with how the person they are sitting next to.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

I’m sure the next pandemic we face will be in some way digitally transmitted. Maybe it already has.

You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

I’m sure the next pandemic we face will be in some way digitally transmitted. Maybe it already has begun.
