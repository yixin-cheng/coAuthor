Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. I",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarra",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime.

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day?

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How w",user,29,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women s",user,31,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particula",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities.

Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So s",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools shou",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just s",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start findin",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For the",user,37,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts ",user,37,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts across the country to consiprovide free pads and tampons to students.",user,37,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts across the country to consider the arguments made herein and provide free pads and tampons to theirstudents.",user,37,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1589,text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.
