Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous.

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do.

Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish. 
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is.

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish. 
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is. I do not like anyting is inherently selfish unless you are purposefully forgoing others for the sake of yourself.  Decdiding to do one of these activities is not forgoing anyone else and only directly affects you. That is why I do not find these type of things selfis",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.  
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is. I do not like anything is inherently selfish unless you are purposefully forgoing others for the sake of yourself.  Deciding to do one of these activities is not forgoing anyone else and only directly affects you. That is why I do not find these type of things selfish. 
I think that if you are going to do one of these activities, you should be well trained and understand the risks.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms.

For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.  
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is. I do not like anything is inherently selfish unless you are purposefully forgoing others for the sake of yourself.  Deciding to do one of these activities is not forgoing anyone else and only directly affects you. That is why I do not find these type of things selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.  
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is. I do not like anything is inherently selfish unless you are purposefully forgoing others for the sake of yourself.  Deciding to do one of these activities is not forgoing anyone else and only directly affects you. That is why I do not find these type of things selfish. 
I think that if you are going to do one of these activities, you should be well trained and understand the risks.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.  
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is. I do not like anything is inherently selfish unless you are purposefully forgoing others for the sake of yourself.  Deciding to do one of these activities is not forgoing anyone else and only directly affects you. That is why I do not find these type of things selfish. 
I think that if you are going to do one of these activities, you should be well trained and understand the risks.
 When you are prepared and understand the risks, just have fun and not worry, you are not being selfish at all.",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
