In my opinion, yes, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper pages of a book because it is the same story. You get the same information, and you can still enjoy the story. You still have to be involved with the story of course, just like you would if you were reading the pages yourself.

Of course you should be reading the book yourself, along with listening to the audiobook at the same time. Pause and rewind as needed to give yourself time to read the pages. I personally know a person who taught themselves how to read using that method. It worked very well for them. 

I can not however say that an audiobook is better than good old fashion reading though because both do have minor differences about them like the fact that you can't see the words as you listen to the audiobook, or that you can't do other things while reading a book.

In my opinion, yes, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper pages of a book because it is the same story. You get the same information, and you can still enjoy the story. You still have to be involved with the story of course, just like you would if you were reading the pages yourself. 
I think that listening to an audiobook is bjusttas beneficialreading a book because iif you are just starting to learn to read, it's like you have a person reading along with you. Of course you should be reading the book yourself, along with listening to the audiobook at the same time. Pause and rewind as needed to give yourself time to read the pages. I personally know a person who taught themselves how to read using that method. It worked very well for them. 

I can not however say that an audiobook is better than good old fashion reading though because both do have minor differences about them like the fact that you can't see the words as you listen to the audiobook, or that you can't do other things while reading a book.

Of course you should be reading the book yourself, along with listening to the audiobook at the same time. Pause and rewind as needed to give yourself time to read the pages.
