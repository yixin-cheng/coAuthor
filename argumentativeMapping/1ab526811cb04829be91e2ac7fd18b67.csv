Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to anyone who needs them. 
 think it's important to understand that pads and tampons are not luxury items.
 They are an absolute necessity for health and function and if a student struggles to afford these items through no fault of their own, they would benefit immensely by having schools that provided them free of charge. Pads and tampons are vital in the same way that Band-Aids, toilet paper,  and other hygiene items are. In some countries where girls have less access to pads and tampons, school is not an option during a female's period. n the United States, there are many people who struggle to afford pads and tampons. and our school system can surely help meet this human need that most all women have.
