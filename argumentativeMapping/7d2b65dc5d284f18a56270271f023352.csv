In my opinion, I prefer reading a book than listening to an audiobook. The main reason is that only by reading a book, can I understand how the story progresses and can I really get to know the character. A writer’s style might be very difficult to understand in an audiobook, but it becomes a lot easier to understand when reading. Also, I think that audiobooks are not worth the money: a book costs less than an audiobook. In addition, books never run out of batteries.  Think of an example, if I am at the beach with my family, an audiobook will be useless. However, if I have a book, I can stay with my family and still enjoy a good book.

In my opinion, I prefer reading a book than listening to an audiobook. The main reason is that only by reading a book, can I understand how the story progresses and can I really get to know the character. A writer’s style might be very difficult to understand in an audiobook, but it becomes a lot easier to understand when reading. Also, I think that audiobooks are not worth the money: a book costs less than an audiobook. In addition, books never run out of batteries.  Think of an example, if I am at the beach with my family, an audiobook will be useless. However, if I have a book, I can stay with my family and still enjoy a good book.
