In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college. Meaning people who went for science, engineering, IT, etc would have to maintain normal jobs to help them with their expenses while athletes get a free ride.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education.

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college. Meaning people who went for science, engineering, IT, etc would have to maintain normal jobs to help them with their expenses while athletes get a free ride.
