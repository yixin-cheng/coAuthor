Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different",user,27,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many dif",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous.

I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

You draw your line when it comes to extreme sports. Ultimately, everyone should do what makes them happy. I am happy

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.
