In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circums",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot.

They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has ato their own preservation.",user,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but st",user,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot.

We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way.

Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of.

We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way.

To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions.

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

Because if a helpless animal is deserving of pity, and help, a helpless human, who is ultimately just another suffering animal,  is deserving of this, as well. It makes no sense to respond to the suffering of one animal, an",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
