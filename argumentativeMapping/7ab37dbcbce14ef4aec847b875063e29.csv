 Because there is such a rapid decline in value of one's interactions on social media, one spends more time on it and less time searching for a real relationship with another person. A lot of people act like movie characters, piecing together a picture of themselves that they wish was true, rather than expressing who they truly are.
AManypeople seem to be on the hunt for perfection in the things and people they idolize.
 They are constantly comparing others to a perfect image they have created in their minds or a standard they've set. On social media and dating apps, you see constant comparisons and negativity. Nothing is ever good enough, or someone is always doing better than you.
We focus on finding attention, likes, good pics-instead of finding real, meaningful people to relate to.
   We are so far removed from natural human contact, our sense of security and well-being are suffering because of it. It's no wonder why there's an increase in anxiety and depression.

It promotes a shallowness in which we can glance over the person and make a judgment of them based on their profile picture, or how they present themselves on a dating app.

 Technology also encourages dishonesty and being manipulative, especially with how easy it is to delete or avoid people on social media and dating apps.  ""Ghosting"" is commonplace-you don't feel like listening? Just never reply back, no explanation needed, zero repercussions.

Technology makes dating worse. It promotes a superficial and shallow view of people as commodities. Rather than seeing people as complex and wonderful, we are presented with a limited and basic message that says, ""here is what I'm good for.""

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Technology makes dating worse. It promotes a superficial and shallow view of people as commodities. Rather than seeing people as complex and wonderful, we are presented with a limited and basic message that says, ""here is what I'm good for.""

AManypeople seem to be on the hunt for perfection in the things and people they idolize.
 They are constantly comparing others to a perfect image they have created in their minds or a standard they've set. On social media and dating apps, you see constant comparisons and negativity. Nothing is ever good enough, or someone is always doing better than you.
We focus on finding attention, likes, good pics-instead of finding real, meaningful people to relate to.
   We are so far removed from natural human contact, our sense of security and well-being are suffering because of it. It's no wonder why there's an increase in anxiety and depression.
