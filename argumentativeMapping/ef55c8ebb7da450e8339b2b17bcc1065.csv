Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not.

This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth.

This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth.

I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not. It's dangerous to drive a car on the freeway, but we don't all stay home, because that is no way to live.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not. It's dangerous to drive a car on the freeway, but we don't all stay home, because that is no way to live. 

I suppose in rare instances a line should be drawn. For example, if the person is the head of their household and is responsible for the care of people, then the activities with the most risk should maybe be avoided. However, this is still an issue that should be left up to the individual.

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not. It's dangerous to drive a car on the freeway, but we don't all stay home, because that is no way to live. 

I suppose in rare instances a line should be drawn. For example, if the person is the head of their household and is responsible for the care of people, then the activities with the most risk should maybe be avoided. However, this is still an issue that should be left up to the individual.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities.
