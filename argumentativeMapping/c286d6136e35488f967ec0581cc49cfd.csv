Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.
  There are medical professionals on hand to treat the boxers.  There are referees who are supposed to protect the health of the boxers as much as possible.   There are gloves that protect

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.
  There are medical professionals on hand to treat the boxers.  There are referees who are supposed to protect the health of the boxers as much as possible.   The trainers of the boxers have the ability to stop the fight by throwing in the towel
