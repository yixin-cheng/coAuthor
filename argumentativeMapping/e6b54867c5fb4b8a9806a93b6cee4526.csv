I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing th",user,10,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself.

I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character.

I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists.

So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists.

The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a hist",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to ov",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes.

So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population.

This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people.

I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, whe",user,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth.

I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men.

Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth. 
In sum, seeing the black male criminal stereotype on the big screen makes me cringe more than any other because I know that overuse of these characters has had a negative impact on society and it's downright wrong.",user,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
