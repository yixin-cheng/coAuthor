In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.  Dating apps have made things so easy.  

I think other technology like social media and texting creates a situation where your romantic partner and you are in touch far too often.   It creates a situation where you are checked on too much.  You aren't able to have any alone time.  I believe that alone time is vital for relationships.  This gives you time to think and process different situations.  I think technology has shrunk how much alone time that we get today.  That can severely hurt a relationship.

I have used dating apps in the past.   I have met people through these apps.  For me, it has been hard to find people who want a meaningful relationship.   Many people are only interested in short-term relationships.   I'm not looking for that.

In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.  Dating apps have made things so easy.  

I think other technology like social media and texting creates a situation where your romantic partner and you are in touch far too often.   It creates a situation where you are checked on too much.  You aren't able to have any alone time.  I believe that alone time is vital for relationships.  This gives you time to think and process different situations.  I think technology has shrunk how much alone time that we get today.  That can severely hurt a relationship.

I have used dating apps in the past.   I have met people through these apps.  For me, it has been hard to find people who want a meaningful relationship.   Many people are only interested in short-term relationships.   I'm not looking for that.

In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.  Dating apps have made things so easy.  

I think other technology like social media and texting creates a situation where your romantic partner and you are in touch far too often.   It creates a situation where you are checked on too much.  You aren't able to have any alone time.  I believe that alone time is vital for relationships.  This gives you time to think and process different situations.  I think technology has shrunk how much alone time that we get today.  That can severely hurt a relationship.

I have used dating apps in the past.   I have met people through these apps.  For me, it has been hard to find people who want a meaningful relationship.   Many people are only interested in short-term relationships.   I'm not looking for that.

In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.  Dating apps have made things so easy.  

I think other technology like social media and texting creates a situation where your romantic partner and you are in touch far too often.   It creates a situation where you are checked on too much.  You aren't able to have any alone time.  I believe that alone time is vital for relationships.  This gives you time to think and process different situations.  I think technology has shrunk how much alone time that we get today.  That can severely hurt a relationship.

I have used dating apps in the past.   I have met people through these apps.  For me, it has been hard to find people who want a meaningful relationship.   Many people are only interested in short-term relationships.   I'm not looking for that.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.  Dating apps have made things so easy.  

I think other technology like social media and texting creates a situation where your romantic partner and you are in touch far too often.   It creates a situation where you are checked on too much.  You aren't able to have any alone time.  I believe that alone time is vital for relationships.  This gives you time to think and process different situations.  I think technology has shrunk how much alone time that we get today.  That can severely hurt a relationship.

I have used dating apps in the past.   I have met people through these apps.  For me, it has been hard to find people who want a meaningful relationship.   Many people are only interested in short-term relationships.   I'm not looking for that.

In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.  Dating apps have made things so easy.  

I think other technology like social media and texting creates a situation where your romantic partner and you are in touch far too often.   It creates a situation where you are checked on too much.  You aren't able to have any alone time.  I believe that alone time is vital for relationships.  This gives you time to think and process different situations.  I think technology has shrunk how much alone time that we get today.  That can severely hurt a relationship.

I have used dating apps in the past.   I have met people through these apps.  For me, it has been hard to find people who want a meaningful relationship.   Many people are only interested in short-term relationships.   I'm not looking for that.  

If you are looking for a meaningful relationship, then I think that technology will harm your chances of having a good relationship.  You'll find yourself being swamped with short-term relationships, or you may not be able to find the person that you want.
