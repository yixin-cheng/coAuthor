Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention.

Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or worse.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep.

Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or worse.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contractor worse.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contracting Covid, or worse.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contracting Covid, or worse.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contracting Covid, or worse.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contracting Covid, or worse.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contracting Covid, or worse.

The past year has been a year of social and environmental changes that have been far more disruptive and hazardous to our lives than the screen time debate. Increased screen time is absolutely trivial by comparison to any of these things, and if someone can say that its the reason for the worst problems they're currently experiencing, I say that person has a lot to be ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?
