What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts.

If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts.

If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys.

If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive?",api,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on ourabout everything.",user,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes.

The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be p",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent.",user,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real.

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.",user,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real.

The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away.

 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do. 

In conclusion, I think that authors and writers and film producers should be able to write whatever they want. If any member of the audience is offended by something that they see, then they should just walk away. But those members of the a",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do.

If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do. 

In conclusion, I think that authors and writers and film producers should be able to write whatever they want.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do. 

In conclusion, I think that authors and writers and film producers should be able to write whatever they want. If any member of the audience is offended by something that they see, then they should just walk away. But those members of the audience who are offended should not try to censor the media or try to police what conse",user,38,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys.

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do. 

In conclusion, I think that authors and writers and film producers should be able to write whatever they want. If any member of the audience is offended by something that they see, then they should just walk away. But those members of the audience who are offended should not try to censor the media or try to police what consenting members of the audience w",user,38,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do. 

In conclusion, I think that authors and writers and film producers should be able to write whatever they want. If any member of the audience is offended by something that they see, then they should just walk away. But those members of the audience who are offended should not try to censor the media or try to police what consenting members of the audience want to see.",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves.
