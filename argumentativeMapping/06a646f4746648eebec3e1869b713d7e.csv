In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the basics. They should learn how to read, write, and do math. These are the basics that will help them succeed in life. 

I think the most important thing I have learned in school is how to read.  There is knowledge about every topic under the sun, if only one can read about it. Reading, and truly understanding any topic is essential to improving and learning, no matter which profession we choose in life.  Being able to read exposes us to new ideas, stimulates our minds, and keeps us curious. 

Reading is important because it helps us to learn and understand things. It will help us in the future because we will be able to read and understand things that we need to know, whatever we are doing. 

Similarly, writing allows us to share our idea with others. Writing is the counterpart to reading-we record our knowledge, to help others improve, sharing ourselves for them to experience. Writing is essential to reading, and vice-versa. 

Math is important because it is the language of science. It is the language of the universe.  Math is the reading and writing of the world we live in. It is the constant expression of our carbon-based lifeforms.

I think the most important thing I have learned in school is how to read.  There is knowledge about every topic under the sun, if only one can read about it. Reading, and truly understanding any topic is essential to improving and learning, no matter which profession we choose in life.  Being able to read exposes us to new ideas, stimulates our minds, and keeps us curious. 

Reading is important because it helps us to learn and understand things. It will help us in the future because we will be able to read and understand things that we need to know, whatever we are doing. 

Similarly, writing allows us to share our idea with others. Writing is the counterpart to reading-we record our knowledge, to help others improve, sharing ourselves for them to experience. Writing is essential to reading, and vice-versa. 

Math is important because it is the language of science. It is the language of the universe. It is exact, unchangeable, and present in everything. Math is the reading and writing of the world we live in. It is the constant scientific expression of our carbon-based lifeforms. ath is important because it allows us to understand the world around us.
 It is the precise reading of what the universe has written. 

Math, reading, and writing are all intrinsically linked, each having an effect on each other, each able to better interpret the others.

I think the most important thing I have learned in school is how to read.  There is knowledge about every topic under the sun, if only one can read about it. Reading, and truly understanding any topic is essential to improving and learning, no matter which profession we choose in life.  Being able to read exposes us to new ideas, stimulates our minds, and keeps us curious.

Math is the reading and writing of the world we live in. It is the constant scientific expression of our carbon-based lifeforms. ath is important because it allows us to understand the world around us.
