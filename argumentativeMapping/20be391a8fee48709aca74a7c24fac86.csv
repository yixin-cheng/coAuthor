Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering.

It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering.

Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering.

Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those wi",user,13,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts.

Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering.

We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome.

Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome. A person should not be viewed as unethical or immoral for devoting themselves for one cause over the other, as others might still help such cause, an",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome. A person should not be viewed as unethical or immoral for devoting themselves for one cause over the other, as others might still help such cause, and they may ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans.

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people.

Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome. A person should not be viewed as unethical or immoral for devoting themselves for one cause over the other, as others might still help such cause, and they may assist indirectly or through other mea",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?
