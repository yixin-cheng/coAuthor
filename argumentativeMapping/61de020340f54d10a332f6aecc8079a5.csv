Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time.

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time.

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace, Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatmor Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time.

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace, Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatment, or Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  Additionally, we're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace, Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatment, or Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction.

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace, Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatment, or Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction. 
e should focus on our own lives, and not worry about what the Kardashians are doing.


We hear about school shootings, building collapses, and the media milks it for everything it can. t's not our fault that these things happen, and we can't do anything about it. on a national scale. We are being used, as consumers of sensational tragedies. 

New stations often make no effort to conceal their bias. We pick someone who agrees with us, and the news becomes an echo chamber of our positions, stifling growth and innovation. 

What we can do, focus locally. We can  raise good children.

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace, Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatment, or Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction. 
e should focus on our own lives, and not worry about what the Kardashians are doing.


We hear about school shootings, building collapses, and the media milks it for everything it can. t's not our fault that these things happen, and we can't do anything about it. on a national scale. We are being used, as consumers of sensational tragedies. 

New stations often make no effort to conceal their bias. We pick someone who agrees with us, and the news becomes an echo chamber of our positions, stifling growth and innovation. 

What we can do, is occasionally read world news, but focus locally. We can raise good children. e can volunteer at our local schools.
