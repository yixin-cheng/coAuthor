Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

  Humans are animals.  We believe we are the apex of the animal world.  We may well be wrong.  Whales and other marine life have shown signs of intelligence approaching that of humans.  Primates are very human-like and in some ways superior.  It is not a stretch to believe that we are not the only intelligent life on this planet and we all have a right to a reasonable life.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is human nature to care more about the welfare of something helpless than something we perceive as being capable.  Human beings will almost always help a child before an adult due to that instinct.  We perceive animals in the same light, helpless and innocent.

Is it right?  That is a question that the 'animal movement' says a resounding 'yes' to.  There is a huge movement to wean us from eating animal products.  There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.
