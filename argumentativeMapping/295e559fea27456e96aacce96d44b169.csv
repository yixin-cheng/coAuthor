Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place.

That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice.

That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life.

Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive.

Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive. 

A lot of time people that go into extreme sports turn out to be great leaders, doing great things for their communities, like saving lives and such. They are not trying die, and they are not trying to hurt other people. It might be selfish to take your own life, but these people are not trying to take their own lives anyways",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place.

Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive. 

A lot of time people that go into extreme sports turn out to be great leaders, doing great things for their communities, like saving lives and such.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive. 

A lot of time people that go into extreme sports turn out to be great leaders, doing great things for their communities, like saving lives and such. They are not trying die, and they are not trying to hurt other people. It might be selfish to take your own life, but these people are not trying to take their own lives anyways.

A lot of time people that go into extreme sports turn out to be great leaders, doing great things for their communities, like saving lives and such. They are not trying die, and they are not trying to hurt other people. It might be selfish to take your own life, but these people are not trying to take their own lives anyways.

Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive. 

A lot of time people that go into extreme sports turn out to be great leaders, doing great things for their communities, like saving lives and such. They are not trying die, and they are not trying to hurt other people. It might be selfish to take your own life, but these people are not trying to take their own lives anyways.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?
