In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.
 But people who prefer audiobooks to reading a physical book epitomize everything that's wrong with our society. Passively consuming information makes all information seem equal.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.
 But people who prefer audiobooks to reading a physical book epitomize everything that's wrong with our society. Passively consuming information makes all information seem equal. Reading has been dumbed down to the simple act of listening, while the physical book has been superseded by the screen of a smart phone. 

Ignorance is on the rise. Just look who was president from 2017 until 2021: someone who had never read a single book in their lives. Is it any wonder that he lived in a world of narcissistic fantasy?

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.

Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.
 But people who prefer audiobooks to reading a physical book epitomize everything that's wrong with our society. Passively consuming information makes all information seem equal. Reading has been dumbed down to the simple act of listening, while the physical book has been superseded by the screen of a smart phone. 

Ignorance is on the rise. Just look who was president from 2017 until 2021: someone who had never read a single book in their lives. Is it any wonder that he lived in a world of narcissistic fantasy?

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to smart people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobooks listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobook listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.
 But people who prefer audiobooks to reading a physical book epitomize everything that's wrong with our society. Passively consuming information makes all information seem equal. Reading has been dumbed down to the simple act of listening, while the physical book has been superseded by the screen of a smart phone.
