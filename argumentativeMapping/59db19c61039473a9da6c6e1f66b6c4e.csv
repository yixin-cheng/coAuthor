Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students w",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students who would have a hard time without them anyway",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students who would have a hard time without them anyways.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students who would have a hard time without them anyways. The programs are subsidized by the government for a reason, which is to help people that are in need and can't afford those products. Even more",user,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students who would have a hard time without them anyways.

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students who would have a hard time without them anyways.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, I believe schools should provide free pads and tampons to students, but only under certain circumstances.  believe that, under the right circumstances, both pads and tampons are necessary products for women, and that they should be provided for free
 and those circumstances are that the students should qualify for government assistance such as free school lunches, maybe their parents are on the SNAP benefit program, things like that. So that not all people try to take advantage of the assistance when they don't need to.

As I am a guy, I have no experience in the period shaming or period poverty, but I can only imagine how terrible and embarrassing it must be for those poor girls. (No pun intended).
I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.
