It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars.

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world.

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.
Over ll, the only change I see technology bringito relationships is that tit'sdestroying them, and in doing so depriving society of any
 real hope of building a stable society in the near future. The new generation lives life in a bubble, and it's terrifying to think of what the future holds in store for humanity.

The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or use angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times its not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.

 real hope of building a stable society in the near future. The new generation lives life in a bubble, and it's terrifying to think of what the future holds in store for humanity. I wish we could go back to the days when people met organically and in person.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or mause angles to achieve a more attractive appearance.
