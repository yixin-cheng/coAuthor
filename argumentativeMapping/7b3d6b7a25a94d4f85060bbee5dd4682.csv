Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin.

If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under themy skirt.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable

This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up.

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious.

I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I w",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress.

I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress.

If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable

I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.

This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.

This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress.

This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress.

I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.

I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes.

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day.

I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too. So",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable

This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress.

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too. So in conclu",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress.

I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too. So in conclusion, schools absol",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress.

When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too.

This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too. So in conclusion, schools absolutely should be providing pads and tampons in their restrooms for students, in my opinion. Ther ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too.

I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too.

I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too. So in conclusion, schools absolutely should be providing pads and tampons in their restrooms for students, in my opinion. There is just no difference",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process.
