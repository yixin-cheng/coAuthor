In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. THere would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.",user,12,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A n",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport.

People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure thems",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that m",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders. 

In general, safetey training is best for everyone, but especially for people who don't know what they are doing. Especially in sports that can cause serious injury or death i",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.

 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders. 

In general, safetey training is best for everyone, but especially for people who don't know what they are doing. Especially in sports that can cause serious injury or death if not done co",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?
