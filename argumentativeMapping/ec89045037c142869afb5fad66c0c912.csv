Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide this for students and most have always provided it but at a small fee for purchase or just for emergencies.  Providing and selling tampons changed after there were cases of blood poisoning from their use and as far as I am aware selling or providing these in school is still banned.

There's no difference between these productions and say band aids, soap, toilet paper, etc.  They are for health and well fare of the student concerned and the surrounding students.  f schools are providing toilet paper, soap, and band aids, they should also provide tampons and pads.


Of course if these items were reasonably priced and were not taxed on top of the price that would help make them more affordable.  Since half the population is female they should be provided free of charge to women of every age, background, and income level.

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide this for students and most have always provided it but at a small fee for purchase or just for emergencies.

Of course if these items were reasonably priced and were not taxed on top of the price that would help make them more affordable.  Since half the population is female they should be provided free of charge to women of every age, background, and income level.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide this for students and most have always provided it but at a small fee for purchase or just for emergencies.  Providing and selling tampons changed after there were cases of blood poisoning from their use and as far as I am aware selling or providing these in school is still banned.

There's no difference between these productions and say band aids, soap, toilet paper, etc.  They are for health and well fare of the student concerned and the surrounding students.  f schools are providing toilet paper, soap, and band aids, they should also provide tampons and pads.


Of course if these items were reasonably priced and were not taxed on top of the price that would help make them more affordable.  Since half the population is female they should be provided free of charge to women of every age, background, and income level.

After all without women and their periods the human race would cease to exist.  Why then do they alone have to pay to manage this?  Every month the product of a woman's choice should be sent to her home free of charge.  It should be regarded as a well deserved thank you for what women do, which only they can do, continue the human race.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide this for students and most have always provided it but at a small fee for purchase or just for emergencies.  Providing and selling tampons changed after there were cases of blood poisoning from their use and as far as I am aware selling or providing these in school is still banned.

There's no difference between these productions and say band aids, soap, toilet paper, etc.  They are for health and well fare of the student concerned and the surrounding students.  f schools are providing toilet paper, soap, and band aids, they should also provide tampons and pads.


Of course if these items were reasonably priced and were not taxed on top of the price that would help make them more affordable.  Since half the population is female they should be provided free of charge to women of every age, background, and income level.

After all without women and their periods the human race would cease to exist.  Why then do they alone have to pay to manage this?  Every month the product of a woman's choice should be sent to her home free of charge.  It should be regarded as a well deserved thank you for what women do, which only they can do, continue the human race.
