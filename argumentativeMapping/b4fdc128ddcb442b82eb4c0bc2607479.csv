What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, I never like the villain. They always end up being just plain evil. I understand that yes, they are necessary for the storyline.  But I have such a hard time with their characters. Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain. 
Another stereotype that I despise is the naive, innocent person.
 Some people are just asking to get themselves into trouble. I can't stand when people are so naïve they don't even realize they are being led into a trap. One example is Sydney from Scream.

In my opinion, I never like the villain. They always end up being just plain evil. I understand that yes, they are necessary for the storyline.  But I have such a hard time with their characters. Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain. 
Another stereotype that I despise is the naive, innocent person.
 Some people are just asking to get themselves into trouble. I can't stand when people are so naïve they don't even realize they are being led into a trap. One example is Sydney from Scream. I feel like she was the biggest weak character.  It was hard to watch her make all the mistakes she made. She was more blind than any of the characters in any horror movies I have ever watched. I kept thinking about how differently I would've acted if I were in her shoes.   I actually never finished the whole series. She",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, I never like the villain. They always end up being just plain evil. I understand that yes, they are necessary for the storyline.  But I have such a hard time with their characters. Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain.

In my opinion, I never like the villain. They always end up being just plain evil. I understand that yes, they are necessary for the storyline.  But I have such a hard time with their characters. Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain. 
Another stereotype that I despise is the naive, innocent person.
 Some people are just asking to get themselves into trouble. I can't stand when people are so naïve they don't even realize they are being led into a trap. One example is Sydney from Scream. I feel like she was the biggest weak character.  It was hard to watch her make all the mistakes she made. She was more blind than any of the characters in any horror movies I have ever watched. I kept thinking about how differently I would've acted if I were in her shoes.   I actually never finished the whole series. She was an example of a movie character that inspired me to become like the opposite.  That'",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Some people are just asking to get themselves into trouble. I can't stand when people are so naïve they don't even realize they are being led into a trap. One example is Sydney from Scream.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain.
