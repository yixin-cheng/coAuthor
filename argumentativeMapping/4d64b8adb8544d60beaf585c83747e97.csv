Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. Tha",user,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler...

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though.

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them.

If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

There are people in 3rd world nations such as north Korea that are staving to death and being beaten to death or shot, yet people would rather donate money to save the puppies instead of trying to save the staving oppressed human beings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

There are people in 3rd world nations such as north Korea that are staving to death and being beaten to death or shot, yet people would rather donate money to save the puppies instead of trying to save the staving oppressed human beings.

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

There are people in 3rd world nations such as north Korea that are staving to death and being beaten to death or shot, yet people would rather donate money to save the puppies instead of trying to save the staving oppressed human beings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.
