Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

Millions of people have vision problems that make it difficult to read. Even large point books are not suitable for them.  This is not a problem confined to people born with vision issues or blindness, but it is a problems almost everyone encounters at some point as they age.
The solution is to listen to books.
 But until about 20 years ago, the only way to obtain this service was to use a volunteer service like Talking Books. This is a service provided by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It is a free service to the blind and visually impaired.
The service is provided by volunteers who read books into a recording device.
 Though the volunteers are well-intentioned, they are not professional readers. The result is that the books are read in a monotone or garbled voice.
Theough the obviouo slution to this problem is to use a professional reader., only a small percentage of released books were also released in audiobook format back then
 And audio books were expensive: a book which costs $25 in print form could cost almost twice that amount when ordered on CDs.
However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.

That brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks. In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

Millions of people have vision problems that make it difficult to read. Even large point books are not suitable for them.  This is not a problem confined to people born with vision issues or blindness, but it is a problems almost everyone encounters at some point as they age.
The solution is to listen to books.
 But until about 20 years ago, the only way to obtain this service was to use a volunteer service like Talking Books. This is a service provided by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It is a free service to the blind and visually impaired.
The service is provided by volunteers who read books into a recording device.
 Though the volunteers are well-intentioned, they are not professional readers. The result is that the books are read in a monotone or garbled voice.
Theough the obviouo slution to this problem is to use a professional reader., only a small percentage of released books were also released in audiobook format back then
 And audio books were expensive: a book which costs $25 in print form could cost almost twice that amount when ordered on CDs.
However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.

That brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks. In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.

However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.

That brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks. In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.

Auidiobooks are a beacon of equal rights and equal access for the disabled, and as such should be subsidized and expanded.

Millions of people have vision problems that make it difficult to read. Even large point books are not suitable for them.  This is not a problem confined to people born with vision issues or blindness, but it is a problems almost everyone encounters at some point as they age.
The solution is to listen to books.
 But until about 20 years ago, the only way to obtain this service was to use a volunteer service like Talking Books. This is a service provided by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It is a free service to the blind and visually impaired.
The service is provided by volunteers who read books into a recording device.
 Though the volunteers are well-intentioned, they are not professional readers. The result is that the books are read in a monotone or garbled voice.
Theough the obviouo slution to this problem is to use a professional reader., only a small percentage of released books were also released in audiobook format back then
 And audio books were expensive: a book which costs $25 in print form could cost almost twice that amount when ordered on CDs.
However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.

That brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks. In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.

Auidiobooks are a beacon of equal rights and equal access for the disabled, and as such should be subsidized and expanded.

Millions of people have vision problems that make it difficult to read. Even large point books are not suitable for them.  This is not a problem confined to people born with vision issues or blindness, but it is a problem almost everyone encounters at some point as they age.
The solution is to listen to books.
 But until about 20 years ago, the only way to obtain this service was to use a volunteer service like Talking Books. This is a service provided by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It is a free service to the blind and visually impaired.
The service is provided by volunteers who read books into a recording device.
 Though the volunteers are well-intentioned, they are not professional readers. The result is that the books cread in a monotonous or garbled voice.
Theough the obviouo slution to this problem is to use a professional reader., only a small percentage of released books were also released in audiobook format back then
 And audio books were expensive: a book which costs $25 in print form could cost almost twice that amount when ordered on CDs.
However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.
