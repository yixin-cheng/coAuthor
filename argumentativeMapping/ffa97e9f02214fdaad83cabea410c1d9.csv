What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that.
