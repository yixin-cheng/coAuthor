In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay.

The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay.

The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay.

The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay.

The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?
