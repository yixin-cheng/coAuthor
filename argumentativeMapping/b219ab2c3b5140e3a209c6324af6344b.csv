The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, people shouldn't worry too much about excessive screen time right now during the pandemic. For most people, it's a great way to keep up with others and stay informed of developments during the pandemic. Maybe previously screens served as an escape from reality but now it's quite the opposite. People use their screens as the way to stay connected to love ones and to the rest of the world during the pandemic. Our screen devices are able to help many people stay and feel connected in a time where isolation and separation can be extreme. 

At least for now, it seems logical to embrace the benefits of our digital devices. Instead of concerning ourselves with excessive screen time, we should focus our efforts on staying healthy, including self-care and plenty of rest. This may mean that we need to unplug from time to time, but screen time is only unhealthy when it takes away from that time when we reflect and care for ourselves. As long as we keep health and balance priorities in life, there should be no detrimental effects from excessive screen use.
