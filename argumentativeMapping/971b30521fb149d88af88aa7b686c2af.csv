In my opinion, sports involve certain degree of danger, so no sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. But I admit that there are lines which should be drawn. Sports should only be played with the consent of every participant; players should have their physical and psychological states tested and certified by qualified specialists.

In most cases, these suggested conditions have been met satisfactorily, so I don't think that any sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. ports should also be conducted freely so that the players will have a sense of freedom.
