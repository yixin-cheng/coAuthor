text-insert,"Should College Athletes Be Paid?

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid with monetary rewards. These athletes receive their scholarship in exchange for their performance on the court, track, or field. The opportunity to play in big games, to impress future employers, and to represent their school is enough compensation for these players. ollege athletes already earn tutors, trainers, and coaching in order to be better players.
