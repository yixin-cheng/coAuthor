In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficie",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature.

There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated i",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life. I understand however that that will be different for everyone. I just hope",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life. I understand however that that will be different for everyone. I just hope all students ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life. I understand however that that will be different for everyone. I just hope all students really take so",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life. I understand however that that will be different for everyone. I just hope all students really take something from their school days and it leads to success in",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.
