In my opinion, the most important things that students should learn are the core subjects, such as English, Maths, Science. Really learning these subjects will set you up for the real world much better then most other subjects. Science because it teaches you how to think critically and come to conclusions rationally. You should be thought the scientific method can be used in your daily life all the time in mostly small but in big ways to. 
nglish because it is something I think everyone should have a strong grasp of.
 It is already used throughout the western world and it exists in Asian and African countries as well. It may become the dominate language worldwide if it is not already. The better you speak, the more serious people will take you. 
Finally math, and that is simply because it is cool. But seriously, building up that part of the brain will enhance many other parts of your brain as well. You will also get to learn the wonders of discovering math. The language of the universe. That in itself makes math so fascinating. Not to mention you will use arithmetic in your daily life on a regular basis for the rest of your life.
