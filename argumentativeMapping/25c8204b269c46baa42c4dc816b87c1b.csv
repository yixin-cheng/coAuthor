In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people.

Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok.

Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger cho",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see.

Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people.

It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see.

Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger choices, things that make me feel like I matter. I want to live in today, making gay people normal, allowing for a space for everyone, and for everyone to feel safe.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger choices, things that make me feel like I matter. I want to live in today, making gay people normal, allowing for a space for everyone, and for everyone to feel safe.
So, if you have a show or movie with stereotypical portrayals of gay people...

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger choices, things that make me feel like I matter. I want to live in today, making gay people normal, allowing for a space for everyone, and for everyone to feel safe.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people.

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.

 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger choices, things that make me feel like I matter. I want to live in today, making gay people normal, allowing for a space for everyone, and for everyone to feel safe.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger choices, things that make me feel like I matter. I want to live in today, making gay people normal, allowing for a space for everyone, and for everyone to feel safe.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.
