How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships.

I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarras",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder.

These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous.

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder.

I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking.

Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence.

I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ones.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ones.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous.

Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder.

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ones. So there is obviously value in them and hopefully they're here to stay.",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
