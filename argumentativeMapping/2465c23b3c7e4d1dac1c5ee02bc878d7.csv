In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen.

If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen.

If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause.

I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference.

If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous.

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you.

We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference.

We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference.

I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause.

We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Be",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start cr",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In short, being informed about current events is the responsible thing to do. It will not only help you b",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In short, being informed about current events is the responsible thing to do. It will not only help you be a better person, but will help you make the world a be",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference.

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In short, being informed about current events is the responsible thing to do. If you want to bIt will not only help you be a better person, but will help you make the world a better place. ",user,25,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference.

If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous.

To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it.

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In short, being informed about current events is the responsible thing to do. If you want to be a part of society, have opinions, and take actions the only choice is to be informed so that you do right anIt will not only help you be a better person, but will help you make the world a better place.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best.
