In my opinion, the written word is best.  It is my preference. I believe it gives a richer experience. Also, reading a book is somewhat like immersing oneself in the world of the author.

There is however something to be said to listening to audiobooks.  Sometimes hearing something said gives one a different perspective.  Additionally, sometimes you can listen when you can't read.  For example, the lights may be out or one is suffering from eyestrain.  Mostly though, I think people listen to audiobooks while they are doing something else hence their attention is divided.  Therefore, they don't get the full experience from the story or the book.  I believe you need to put your full attention into it.

Audiobooks are of course a boon to those with learning disabilities or those who are vision impaired.  Audiobooks open a world that is otherwise largely closed to them.  We should support them for that reason if no other.  The rising popularity of audiobooks among the general population has done just that.  Therefore the visually impaired or learning disabled have a much larger field to choose from where once it was quite small and very expensive. Many of the rare and out of print books have been converted to audio format.

There is however something to be said to listening to audiobooks.  Sometimes hearing something said gives one a different perspective.  Additionally, sometimes you can listen when you can't read.  For example, the lights may be out or one is suffering from eyestrain.  Mostly though, I think people listen to audiobooks while they are doing something else hence their attention is divided.
