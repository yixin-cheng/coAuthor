In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the basics. Those will get you through life if you go to college or not. Once you have learned those then you can focus on figuring out who you are. Finding yourself is really the most important part of school. You learn who you are and what you like in yourself and in others. It's a social learning experience just as much as it is about actual learning. 

People will take different things away from the experience. Some will learn how to work with others and how to be a team player. Others will learn that they prefer to keep to themselves in life. Some will learn how to be a leader and others will learn how to follow. These things will help to guide you in life. You'll figure out the type of job that may work for you. You'll also figure out who you want to associate with. 
I have learned a lot in school.
 For me it was just learning about myself primarily, but that was important. I learned that I like to take a different path than most. I like to do things my own way. That's what makes me happy. I'm not someone who wants to be defined by a specific title or job. People can't always understand that, but I'm okay with that.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the basics. Those will get you through life if you go to college or not. Once you have learned those then you can focus on figuring out who you are. Finding yourself is really the most important part of school. You learn who you are and what you like in yourself and in others. It's a social learning experience just as much as it is about actual learning. 

People will take different things away from the experience. Some will learn how to work with others and how to be a team player. Others will learn that they prefer to keep to themselves in life. Some will learn how to be a leader and others will learn how to follow. These things will help to guide you in life. You'll figure out the type of job that may work for you. You'll also figure out who you want to associate with. 
I have learned a lot in school.
 For me it was just learning about myself primarily, but that was important. I learned that I like to take a different path than most. I like to do things my own way. That's what makes me happy. I'm not someone who wants to be defined by a specific title or job. People can't always understand that, but I'm okay with that.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the basics. Those will get you through life if you go to college or not. Once you have learned those then you can focus on figuring out who you are. Finding yourself is really the most important part of school. You learn who you are and what you like in yourself and in others. It's a social learning experience just as much as it is about actual learning. 

People will take different things away from the experience. Some will learn how to work with others and how to be a team player. Others will learn that they prefer to keep to themselves in life. Some will learn how to be a leader and others will learn how to follow. These things will help to guide you in life. You'll figure out the type of job that may work for you. You'll also figure out who you want to associate with. 
I have learned a lot in school.
 For me it was just learning about myself primarily, but that was important. I learned that I like to take a different path than most. I like to do things my own way. That's what makes me happy.

Once you have learned those then you can focus on figuring out who you are. Finding yourself is really the most important part of school.

People will take different things away from the experience. Some will learn how to work with others and how to be a team player. Others will learn that they prefer to keep to themselves in life. Some will learn how to be a leader and others will learn how to follow. These things will help to guide you in life. You'll figure out the type of job that may work for you. You'll also figure out who you want to associate with. 
I have learned a lot in school.
 For me it was just learning about myself primarily, but that was important. I learned that I like to take a different path than most. I like to do things my own way. That's what makes me happy.
