In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others.

Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life.

They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

These things are not really the job of the public school system, though. They are the job of the parents, society at large, colleges, and vocational schools. The public schools try to do too much already. They should instead focus on the basics, and leave the rest to other institutions, and endeavor to provide children with",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

These things are not really the job of the public school system, though. They are the job of the parents, society at large, colleges, and vocational schools. The public schools try to do too much already. They should instead focus on the basics, and leave the rest to other institutions, and endeavor to provide children with a foundation upon which they can build their future.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

These things are not really the job of the public school system, though. They are the job of the parents, society at large, colleges, and vocational schools. The public schools try to do too much already. They should instead focus on the basics, and leave the rest to other institutions, and endeavor to provide children with a foundation upon which they can build their future.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

These things are not really the job of the public school system, though. They are the job of the parents, society at large, colleges, and vocational schools. The public schools try to do too much already. They should instead focus on the basics, and leave the rest to other institutions, and endeavor to provide children with a foundation upon which they can build their future. If schools are able to construct this basic foundation, other institutions will be able to build upon that foundation, and the students will be better off for it,",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
