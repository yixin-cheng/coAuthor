Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more.

As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

When media works fail even the simplest tests of verisimilitude,  they fail at the most basic level.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

When media works fail even the simplest tests of verisimilitude,  they fail at the most basic level. If an author is to demonstrate that they are not interested in creating a work that is meaningful or relevant to the audience, then they don't deserve anybody's time of day.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

When media works fail even the simplest tests of verisimilitude,  they fail at the most basic level. If an author is to demonstrate that they are not interested in creating a work that is meaningful or relevant to the audience, then they don't deserve anybody's time of day.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings.

Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

When media works fail even the simplest tests of verisimilitude,  they fail at the most basic level. If an author is to demonstrate that they are not interested in creating a work that is meaningful or relevant to the audience, then they don't deserve anybody's time of day.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

When media works fail even the simplest tests of verisimilitude,  they fail at the most basic level. If an author is to demonstrate that they are not interested in creating a work that is meaningful or relevant to the audience, then they don't deserve anybody's time of day.

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more.
