My generation will always be plagued by it. A large portion of us will forever see blonds as a little dumber then the rest because we were conditioned that way. I'm not saying that all blondes are smart either, but what I am saying is that the stereotype is very real and it hurts. I bet it has even effected their pay over the years. I'm assuming countless girls have been teased about it all their lives. I'm sure it has effected their self esteem and confidence especially in the work place. Its a stereotype I would like to see disappear because we are all dumb when it comes to most things in life. Nobody should be singling out any hair color when we are all severely ill informed on most things. What may be percieved as a harmless stereotype actually ruins lives or at least partially  and we need to recognize that in order to fix it. ",user,20,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, its the stereotypical, dumb blonde that really cheeses my grits. Its just pure nonsense. I mean, I have a friend who is a blonde and she is the smartest person I know. That right there should tell you something. It hurts all other blond women.  Whether people realize it or not they may view blonds in a more negative light compared to other hair colors. Its been going on for as long as I can remember, especially in the 80's and 90's. It appears to have eased up a bit but I still hear it or see it on a regular basis.
