In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is art. Yes I know most people would disagree with me here, but hear me out. Art is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you express yourself, how to be yourself. Art also teaches a student creativity. Creativity is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you think outside the box. 

Art comes in so many forms, that if we completely removed it from our lives, we would really miss it and then realize how important it is. Inventors are inventive in a way because art gives their imaginations strength to come up with ideas for products and services. Art plays a major role in our lives on an everyday basis, and most of us do not even realize it. 

Some of the forms of art are painting, drawing, sculpting, and music just name a few. Without art, there would be no entertaining movies or TV shows. There would be no beautiful architecture, like the Eiffel Tower. There would be no Mona Lisa. There would be no music, or comedy, or even mimes that entertain us on the street for a dollar or two.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is art. Yes I know most people would disagree with me here, but hear me out. Art is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you express yourself, how to be yourself. Art also teaches a student creativity. Creativity is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you think outside the box. 

Art comes in so many forms, that if we completely removed it from our lives, we would really miss it and then realize how important it is. Inventors are inventive in a way because art gives their imaginations strength to come up with ideas for products and services. Art plays a major role in our lives on an everyday basis, and most of us do not even realize it. 

Some of the forms of art are painting, drawing, sculpting, and music just name a few. Without art, there would be no entertaining movies or TV shows. There would be no beautiful architecture, like the Eiffel Tower. There would be no Mona Lisa. There would be no music, or comedy, or even mimes that entertain us on the street for a dollar or two.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is art. Yes I know most people would disagree with me here, but hear me out. Art is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you express yourself, how to be yourself. Art also teaches a student creativity. Creativity is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you think outside the box. 

Art comes in so many forms, that if we completely removed it from our lives, we would really miss it and then realize how important it is. Inventors are inventive in a way because art gives their imaginations strength to come up with ideas for products and services. Art plays a major role in our lives on an everyday basis, and most of us do not even realize it. 

Some of the forms of art are painting, drawing, sculpting, and music just name a few. Without art, there would be no entertaining movies or TV shows. There would be no beautiful architecture, like the Eiffel Tower. There would be no Mona Lisa. There would be no music, or comedy, or even mimes that entertain us on the street for a dollar or two.

Without art, this world would be a very dull, plain, and boring place. That is why I believe that art is the most important subject for students to learn while in school. It can also make you rich sometimes.",user,20,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
