I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older.

This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held.

 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held.

 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.

For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open anmabout their romantic relationships, and to share them with others, which can help to improve the way people feel about",user,23,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communiabout their romantic relationships, and to share them with others, which can help to improve the way people feel about",user,23,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows peopshare them with others, which can help to improve the way people feel about",user,23,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thou with others, which can help to improve the way people feel about",user,23,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over tim",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.

 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time. While some might still benefit through not using technology for dating as much as others, the prescence of technology ought to be considered",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time. While some might still benefit through not using technology for dating as much as others, the presence of technology ought to be considered in embraced in modern society, in terms of the benefits ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time. While some might still benefit through not using technology for dating as much as others, the presence of technology ought to be considered in embraced in modern society, in terms of the benefits it offers to ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in.

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older.

 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another.

I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time. While some might still benefit through not using technology for dating as much as others, the presence of technology ought to be considered in embraced in modern society, in terms of the benefits it offers in maintaining relationships with one ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
