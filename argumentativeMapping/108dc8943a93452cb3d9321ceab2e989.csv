I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hotat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.

There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.
 I began to dream.

There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.
 I began to dream.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.
 I began to dream.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.
 I began to dream.

On graduation day, not a single member of my family came to watch me get my diploma. But Brother Marian was there, and came looking for me after the ceremony. He was the only person who cared enough to come and find me.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.
 I began to dream.

On graduation day, not a single member of my family came to watch me get my diploma. But Brother Marian was there, and came looking for me after the ceremony. He was the only person who cared enough to come and find me.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkisons. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his dishevel brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted, understood, noticed and liked by him. He was smart, kind, gentle. and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher, but he was also a good man.

My situation at the time I took his class was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (virtually nonexistent) friends. I was a lonely, angry, confused and very depressed teenager.
Brother Marian was the first person I ever met who seemed to understand me., who seemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply. That something was hope.
I began to bhave a fainh hope tat I could be a good person, that I could be happy, that I could have a good life.
 That was a game-changer.
I began to read books.
 I began to dream.

On graduation day, not a single member of my family came to watch me get my diploma. But Brother Marian was there, and came looking for me after the ceremony. He was the only person who cared enough to come and find me.

But we missed each other and I never was to see him again. Through the decaude, I have tried to find him, but there is no real trail and I thin",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
