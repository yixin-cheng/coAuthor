Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that some people are more empathic towards the suffering of animals because most people have pets, and because of that they put into their imaginations that the suffering of an animal they see on TV, or where ever else, as though it could be happening to their pet. 

As far as tourists suffering goes, as a former tourist myself, people in a foreign land are interested in the tourist but do not really seem to care that much. Maybe even because of human prejudice. They do not see others who are not related to them in some way as inferior.

Many people forget that humans are animals also, so in a way humans can fall under animal suffering as well. So yes, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare while ignoring human welfare.

In my opinion, I think that some people are more empathic towards the suffering of animals because most people have pets, and because of that they put into their imaginations that the suffering of an animal they see on TV, or where ever else, as though it could be happening to their pet. 

As far as tourists suffering goes, as a former tourist myself, people in a foreign land are interested in the tourist but do not really seem to care that much. Maybe even because of human prejudice. They do not see others who are not related to them in some way as inferior.

Many people forget that humans are animals also, so in a way humans can fall under animal suffering as well. So yes, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare while ignoring human welfare.
I think that people should focus on both to be honest. It is wrong to treat an animal badly, but it is also just as wrong to treat a person badly also. Animals and Humans are living things and to abuse them in any way is a bad thing.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that some people are more empathic towards the suffering of animals because most people have pets, and because of that they put into their imaginations that the suffering of an animal they see on TV, or where ever else, as though it could be happening to their pet.
