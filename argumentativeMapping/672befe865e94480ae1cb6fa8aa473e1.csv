Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In some ways, many if not all sports are selfish to pursue. The pursuit of any sport requires dedication, patience and often sacrifice to achieve one's goals, which includes prestige and reputation.

It is often for fame and prestige, while some do it to prove themselves that they can. It is often about pushing the limits of what is possible, and leaving behind a legacy. Those people that do break the boundaries of the sports are often revered by many, who hear their achievements and see what can be achieved with effort and time.

Pursuing those sports are a conscious action people take, who are often well aware of the stakes and dangers found in the sport.

In terms of what a person finds is too dangerous to pursue, that lies in the person and how they perceive said sport. Some might perceive mountain climbing as being too dangerous and decline to even attempt it, while others will put in all of the effort, spending years getting better at it, to accomplish feats and impressive displays of prowess. What a person deems is dangerous, might be doable to another person. Thus I doubt that there will be a sport that exists in the world that would be considered by all as too dangerous to do, especially since high risk sports have been around for so long, with people always finding a way to up the ante of the sport.

Those people that do break the boundaries of the sports are often revered by many, who hear their achievements and see what can be achieved with effort and time. In that cases, pursuing those sports have indirect benefits to others who hear of such achievements.

Pursuing those sports are a conscious action people take, who are often well aware of the stakes and dangers found in the sport.

In terms of what a person finds is too dangerous to pursue, that lies in the person and how they perceive said sport. Some might perceive mountain climbing as being too dangerous and decline to even attempt it, while others will put in all of the effort, spending years getting better at it, to accomplish feats and impressive displays of prowess. What a person deems is dangerous, might be doable to another person.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In some ways, many if not all sports are selfish to pursue. The pursuit of any sport requires dedication, patience and often sacrifice to achieve one's goals, which includes prestige and reputation. The top athletes are revered by many, but their actions do not necessarily benefit others directly. Rather, many athletes serve as sources of inspiration, to motivate others to achieve their goals and overcoming obstacles, even if it isn't regarding the same sport or activity. W
hen it comes to high risk sports, the cathlete puts time and effort to train and hone their abilities, to meet with exceedingly high demands that are associated with those kind of sports. Like other sports, the end results or reasons for why such people would do high risk sports deemed dangerous are primarily self-serving. It is often for fame and prestige, while some do it to prove themselves that they can. It is often about pushing the limits of what is possible, and leaving behind a legacy. Those people that do break the boundaries of the sports are often revered by many, who hear their achievements and see what can be achieved with effort and time. In that cases, pursuing those sports have indirect benefits to others who hear of such achievements. Many can be inspired by tales of people who climb supposedly unscaleable mountains, or people who despite the risk of some sports, were able to break world records. Pursuing those sports are a conscious action people take, who are often well aware of the stakes and dangers found in the sport.

In terms of what a person finds is too dangerous to pursue, that lies in the person and how they perceive said sport. Some might perceive mountain climbing as being too dangerous and decline to even attempt it, while others will put in all of the effort, spending years getting better at it, to accomplish feats and impressive displays of prowess. What a person deems is dangerous, might be doable to another person. Thus I doubt that there will be a sport that exists in the world that would be considered by all as too dangerous to do, especially since high risk sports have been around for so long, with people always finding a way to up the ante of the sport. The important thing to note is that the athletes and participants of high risk sports are aware of the dangers, and that they take the necessary precautions to minimize failure.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In some ways, many if not all sports are selfish to pursue. The pursuit of any sport requires dedication, patience and often sacrifice to achieve one's goals, which includes prestige and reputation.

Those people that do break the boundaries of the sports are often revered by many, who hear their achievements and see what can be achieved with effort and time. In that cases, pursuing those sports have indirect benefits to others who hear of such achievements.

What a person deems is dangerous, might be doable to another person. Thus I doubt that there will be a sport that exists in the world that would be considered by all as too dangerous to do, especially since high risk sports have been around for so long, with people always finding a way to up the ante of the sport.

In some ways, many if not all sports are selfish to pursue. The pursuit of any sport requires dedication, patience and often sacrifice to achieve one's goals, which includes prestige and reputation. The top athletes are revered by many, but their actions do not necessarily benefit others directly. Rather, many athletes serve as sources of inspiration, to motivate others to achieve their goals and overcoming obstacles, even if it isn't regarding the same sport or activity. W
hen it comes to high risk sports, the cathlete puts time and effort to train and hone their abilities, to meet with exceedingly high demands that are associated with those kind of sports. Like other sports, the end results or reasons for why such people would do high risk sports deemed dangerous are primarily self-serving. It is often for fame and prestige, while some do it to prove themselves that they can. It is often about pushing the limits of what is possible, and leaving behind a legacy. Those people that do break the boundaries of the sports are often revered by many, who hear their achievements and see what can be achieved with effort and time. In that cases, pursuing those sports have indirect benefits to others who hear of such achievements. Many can be inspired by tales of people who climb supposedly unscaleable mountains, or people who despite the risk of some sports, were able to break world records. Pursuing those sports are a conscious action people take, who are often well aware of the stakes and dangers found in the sport.

In terms of what a person finds is too dangerous to pursue, that lies in the person and how they perceive said sport.

What a person deems is dangerous, might be doable to another person. Thus I doubt that there will be a sport that exists in the world that would be considered by all as too dangerous to do, especially since high risk sports have been around for so long, with people always finding a way to up the ante of the sport. The important thing to note is that the athletes and participants of high risk sports need to aware of the dangers, and that they take the necessary precautions to minimize failure. Through that, they can not only get better at the sport, but achieve their hopes and aspirations regarding the sport itself.",user,20,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
