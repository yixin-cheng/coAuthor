In my opinion, spending so much time with our faces in front of screens is making insidious changes within us which we should definitely be worried about.  am not talking about the obvious physical changes like the fact that we are all getting fat and our eyesight is getting worse.
 There are deep changes happening within our minds and spirits which we cannot know the ramifications of. There is no doubt that our modern devices come with inherent benefits. But there are also many negative consequences which we are just beginning to understand. Having all this information available is clearly something that we must see as a positive thing. But, let's be honest with ourselves. Do we really spend most of our time in front of screens learning and improving our minds? Or do we mostly just use our devices to distract ourselves from the world around us? We are becoming addicted to constant distraction and losing our normal interactive functionality. There is something very damaging, in the long run, about not ever taking a moment for quiet self reflection.  am not saying that we should all go back to the old days of sitting in front of the TV for hours on end.
 That was the precursor to this culture of distraction. Now, with modern devices, we take our TV (our distraction) with us everywhere we go. We must not let this addictive tendency control us. It's important to take back our attention, our very minds, for the sake of our mental health. bbbb",user,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?
