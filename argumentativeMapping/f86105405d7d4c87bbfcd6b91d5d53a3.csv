Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why?

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
