In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethicia issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. When you put everything aside, it's just not fair. ",user,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. ",user,23,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though i",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that it isn't fair to students who are not athletes. All students who pay to go to college should be treated equal. This isn't high s",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.
