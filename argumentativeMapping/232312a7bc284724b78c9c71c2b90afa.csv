By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices.  he benefits of screen time are many and include:
 cnnecting with family and friends
, while at the same time, reducing the risk of transmitting the virus; staying informed about the latest news and developments; and managing our work, and bills, from the comfort of home. By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

In conclusion, increased screen time is enabling us to do more, and do it better, than we would otherwise be able to do. It is making an untenable situation more bearable, and it is saving lives. T",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices.  he benefits of screen time are many and include:

, while at the same time, reducing the risk of transmitting the virus; staying informed about the latest news and developments; and managing our work, and bills, from the comfort of home. By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

In conclusion, increased screen time is enabling us to do more, and do it better, than we would otherwise be able to do. It is making an untenable situation more bearable, and it is saving lives. To not embrace it now, when ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices.  he benefits of screen time are many and include:
 cnnecting with family and friends
, while at the same time, reducing the risk of transmitting the virus; staying informed about the latest news and developments; and managing our work, and bills, from the comfort of home. By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

In conclusion, increased screen time is enabling us to do more, and do it better, than we would otherwise be able to do. It is making an untenable situation more bearable, and it is saving lives. To not embrace it now, when it's most needed and useful, would be to miss out on the benefits of our digital devices, doing what tand to miss out on the opportunity to save lives.",user,22,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

In conclusion, increased screen time is enabling us to do more, and do it better, than we would otherwise be able to do. It is making an untenable situation more bearable, and it is saving lives.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices.  he benefits of screen time are many and include:
 cnnecting with family and friends
, while at the same time, reducing the risk of transmitting the virus; staying informed about the latest news and developments; and managing our work, and bills, from the comfort of home. By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

Critics of screen time will say that we should be spending our time in person with family and friends, not on our screens. That would be optimum, of course, but spending time with them online is better than not spending time with them at all. They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.
