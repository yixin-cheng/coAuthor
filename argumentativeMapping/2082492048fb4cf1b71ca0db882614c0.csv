In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think it is good that there are people who are concerned about animal welfare. Not everyone considers themselves to be an animal lover, and even some animal lovers don't have the time or resources to help animals. 
I think it is important to help humans as well as animals.
 I think it is more engrained in our culture to help other people above all else. Helping animals is not as common, and people who do help animals are often seen as strange. The population of volunteers at animal organizations is small. Furthermore, there are many people who don't want to help animals because they believe that animals are not as important as humans.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think it is good that there are people who are concerned about animal welfare. Not everyone considers themselves to be an animal lover, and even some animal lovers don't have the time or resources to help animals. 
I think it is important to help humans as well as animals.
 I think it is more engrained in our culture to help other people above all else. Helping animals is not as common, and people who do help animals are often seen as strange. The population of volunteers at animal organizations is small. Furthermore, there are many people who don't want to help animals because they believe that animals are not as important as humans. They are lacking in resources and labor. They need more help than anyone.  In conclusion, I think it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Both are very important and require different types of attention.",user,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
