In my opinion, students should learn how to be independent and responsible for their actions in school. They should also learn how to be a good person and how to be a good citizen. In this way, it is easier for them to be successful in their career in the future. 

Being independent is the most basic skill to survive in the society. If you are independent, you can do anything on your own. You can make your own decisions and you can solve problems by yourself. You can also take care of yourself and not rely on others. 
Being responsible for your actions is also very important.
 If you are responsible, you will not do anything that is bad for yourself or others because you will think twice before making a decision. You will also be careful about your actions because you know that you have to take responsibility for them. All these result will result in everyone being happy and safe.
Being a good person is also very important.
 If you are a good person, you will not do anything that is bad for yourself or others, nor will you do anything that will hurt the society. A good citizen will respect the rules and laws of the society and will help others. 

As a conclusion, students should learn how to be independent and responsible for their actions in school, which is very important for them to enter the society and build their successful careers.",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
