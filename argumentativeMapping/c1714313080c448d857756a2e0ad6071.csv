For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.

For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.  


o Why Not Pay Students to Play?
  Ultimately, I believe there are many organizations who do not wish to share the profit with these athletes.  They understand that their share of the financial pie goes down when the athletes are allowed to sit at the table.  McDavis mentions that paying athletes would create an unfair advantage for big sports programs.  However, that is already occurring.  Big sports programs already have many ways to attract top talent.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.

  Ultimately, I believe there are many organizations who do not wish to share the profit with these athletes.  They understand that their share of the financial pie goes down when the athletes are allowed to sit at the table.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.  


o Why Not Pay Students to Play?
  Ultimately, I believe there are many organizations who do not wish to share the profit with these athletes.  They understand that their share of the financial pie goes down when the athletes are allowed to sit at the table.  McDavis mentions that paying athletes would create an unfair advantage for big sports programs.  However, that is already occurring.  Big sports programs already have many ways to attract top talent.

If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.  


o Why Not Pay Students to Play?
  Ultimately, I believe there are many organizations who do not wish to share the profit with these athletes.  They understand that their share of the financial pie goes down when the athletes are allowed to sit at the table.  McDavis mentions that paying athletes would create an unfair advantage for big sports programs.  However, that is already occurring.  Big sports programs already have many ways to attract top talent.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.  


o Why Not Pay Students to Play?
  Ultimately, I believe there are many organizations who do not wish to share the profit with these athletes.  They understand that their share of the financial pie goes down when the athletes are allowed to sit at the table.  McDavis mentions that paying athletes would create an unfair advantage for big sports programs.  However, that is already occurring.  Big sports programs already have many ways to attract top talent.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.
