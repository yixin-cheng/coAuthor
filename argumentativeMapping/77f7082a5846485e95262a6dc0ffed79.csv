In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes.

It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money.

It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money.

It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves. 

The third and most important reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would change the nature of college sports. I've always personally found it more exciting to watch college sports than pro sports because I know the athletes are doing it for the love of the game and are maybe even more passionate about it.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves. 

The third and most important reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would change the nature of college sports. I've always personally found it more exciting to watch college sports than pro sports because I know the athletes are doing it for the love of the game and are maybe even more passionate about it.
