Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno.

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress.

 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal.

And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno.

 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal.

And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries.

After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal.

And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to pr",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean.

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story.

In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns.

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

So in conclusion, I think that extreme sports enthusiasts should be entitled to pursue their hobby without fear of persecution based on the inherent risk present in such participation. But let it b",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.

But let it be clear that I am not supporting anything that violates any laws, of which I am aware no such laws exist. And of course, safety measures should be taken.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

So in conclusion, I think that extreme sports enthusiasts should be entitled to pursue their hobby without fear of persecution based on the inherent risk present in such participation.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

So in conclusion, I think that extreme sports enthusiasts should be entitled to pursue their hobby without fear of persecution based on the inherent risk present in such participation. But let it be clear that I am not supporting anything that violates any laws, of which I am aware no such laws exist.

So in conclusion, I think that extreme sports enthusiasts should be entitled to pursue their hobby without fear of persecution based on the inherent risk present in such participation. But let it be clear that I am not supporting anything that violates any laws, of which I am aware no such laws exist.

text-insert,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

So in conclusion, I think that extreme sports enthusiasts should be entitled to pursue their hobby without fear of persecution based on the inherent risk present in such participation. But let it be clear that I am not supporting anything that violates any laws, of which I am aware no such laws exist. And of course, safety measures should be taken, because there are still risks to be aware of.
