In my opinion, has had a beneficial impact on dating, with some provisos.    think it has made it easier to meet people, especially if you are shy or introverted., or you are in a situation where it is difficult to meet people, due to working hours, or family commitments.   Another positive is that it has opened up a far broader range of people to meet, rather than just those you work with or meet in social situations.   It has also made it easier to communicate with people, and to get to know them before you meet them.  You have now, usually, been pre matched with people that are similar to you, with shared interests and views.   This can be a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing.  There are those that just use the apps for causal relationships when others are looking for something more permanent.   There are also those that use the apps to find a partner for a one night stand.  The pre sorting also means that you might not get to experience people from varied backgrounds.  People also judge people on appearance on the apps, making spur of the moment decisions on someone's appearance, rather than getting to know the true person and developing a relationship that way.   I think that the apps have also made it easier for people to be dishonest, and to lie about their age, or their appearance.  H",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
