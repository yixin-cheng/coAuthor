I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservastory over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world.

There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world.

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening.

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

 I think it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. It's important to know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening.

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

 I think it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. It's important to know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world.

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world.

 I think it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. It's important to know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again.

Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again.

Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world.

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stori

 I think it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. It's important to know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you 

 I think it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. It's important to know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening.

It's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. It's important to know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.

As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced, and not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening.

Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you can also get local news from friends and family.  This helps build strong ties in local communities!

It's also important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You shou know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanities issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced in o, but not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you can also get local news from friends and family.  This helps build strong ties in local communities!

It's also important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanity's issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced in our news consum, but not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station so it was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy and differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you can also get local news from friends and family.  This helps build strong ties in local communities!

It's also important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.

It's also important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanity's issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced in our news consumption, but not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station. It was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy, and being differing views in news are beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology became more advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it became easier to access the information from all around the world.

It's also important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanity's issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced in our news consumption, but not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station. It was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy, and being exposed to differing views in news stories is beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology becaoe smore advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it bis asier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you can also get local news from friends and family.  This helps build strong ties in local communities!

It's also important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanity's issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you can also get local news from friends and family.  This helps build strong ties in local communities!

Finally, it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanity's issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!
