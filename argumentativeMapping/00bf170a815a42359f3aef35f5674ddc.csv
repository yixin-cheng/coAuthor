In my opinion, we should absolutely pay college athletes. Why on earth shouldn’t they be compensated for what they are doing for the school? The truth is that the entire system of college sports is built on exploitation that is connected to a broader exploitative system. The universities profit greatly from these athletes who, in many cases, are putting their health on the line.

In my opinion, we should absolutely pay college athletes. Why on earth shouldn’t they be compensated for what they are doing for the school? The truth is that the entire system of college sports is built on exploitation that is connected to a broader exploitative system. The universities profit greatly from these athletes who, in many cases, are putting their health on the line. There is also the possibility that young people are sustaining long-term damage from participating in sports. Some might point out that some of these athletes are receiving scholarships in return for playing and therefore getting a free education. This argument only highlights the broader exploitation at play. College tuitions themselves are greatly inflated in the US. The revenue that the schools are accruing from these young athletes is far greater that any loss from the exorbitant tuition fees.

In my opinion, we should absolutely pay college athletes. Why on earth shouldn’t they be compensated for what they are doing for the school? The truth is that the entire system of college sports is built on exploitation that is connected to a broader exploitative system. The universities profit greatly from these athletes who, in many cases, are putting their health on the line. There is also the possibility that young people are sustaining long-term damage from participating in sports. Some might point out that some of these athletes are receiving scholarships in return for playing and therefore getting a free education. This argument only highlights the broader exploitation at play. College tuitions themselves are greatly inflated in the US. The revenue that the schools are accruing from these young athletes is far greater that any loss from the exorbitant tuition fees. And even when you allow that these students are getting a free education, why should it be at the expense of some other young person?

In my opinion, we should absolutely pay college athletes. Why on earth shouldn’t they be compensated for what they are doing for the school? The truth is that the entire system of college sports is built on exploitation that is connected to a broader exploitative system. The universities profit greatly from these athletes who, in many cases, are putting their health on the line. There is also the possibility that young people are sustaining long-term damage from participating in sports. Some might point out that some of these athletes are receiving scholarships in return for playing and therefore getting a free education. This argument only highlights the broader exploitation at play. College tuitions themselves are greatly inflated in the US. The revenue that the schools are accruing from these young athletes is far greater that any loss from the exorbitant tuition fees.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, we should absolutely pay college athletes. Why on earth shouldn’t they be compensated for what they are doing for the school? The truth is that the entire system of college sports is built on exploitation that is connected to a broader exploitative system. The universities profit greatly from these athletes who, in many cases, are putting their health on the line. There is also the possibility that young people are sustaining long-term damage from participating in sports. Some might point out that some of these athletes are receiving scholarships in return for playing and therefore getting a free education. This argument only highlights the broader exploitation at play. College tuitions themselves are greatly inflated in the US. The revenue that the schools are accruing from these young athletes is far greater that any loss from the exorbitant tuition fees.
