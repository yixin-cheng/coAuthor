In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and attention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benefit from their hard work and contributions to the program.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and positivattention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benefit from their hard work and contributions to the program.
