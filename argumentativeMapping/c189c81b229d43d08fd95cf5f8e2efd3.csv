In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text. It's

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos.

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text.

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text. It's also really hard to convey someone's tone and meaning communicating this way.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text. It's also really hard to convey someone's tone and meaning communicating this way.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text. It's also really hard to convey someone's tone and meaning communicating this way.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text.

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos.
