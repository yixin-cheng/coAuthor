This will lead to less and less couples getting married as this sort of relationship is not legally binding. The traditional value in the society will be challenged in this way. People have fewer genuine relationships nowadays and so they will be lonely all their lives.

In my opinion, technology worsen romantic interactions. I have read many reports of women and men stalking their partners, setting up surveillance equipment within each partner’s bedrooms and watching cell phone activity.  All these would cause conflicts and mistrust between the couples. In addition, over time I believe couples will have less and less interest in face-to-face meetings because they will be able to achieve a romantic relationship with people online. This will lead to less and less couples getting married as this sort of relationship is not legally binding. The traditional value in the society will be challenged in this way. People have fewer genuine relationships nowadays and so they will be lonely all their lives.  There is also a concern that some people will abuse the use of dating apps by pretending to be interested in long-term relationships but will hide such intentions. This again will ruin the relationship between the couples who are dating through dating apps. This has happened before. Because people do not trust each other, they are quick to believe their partner is having a love affair. As a result, they do many things to the suspects including stalking and monitoring cell phone activities. This will result in breaking up relationships and might lead to even divorce as a consequence. Thus, I think that technology worsen romantic interactions .",user,21,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology worsen romantic interactions. I have read many reports of women and men stalking their partners, setting up surveillance equipment within each partner’s bedrooms and watching cell phone activity.  All these would cause conflicts and mistrust between the couples. In addition, over time I believe couples will have less and less interest in face-to-face meetings because they will be able to achieve a romantic relationship with people online. This will lead to less and less couples getting married as this sort of relationship is not legally binding. The traditional value in the society will be challenged in this way. People have fewer genuine relationships nowadays and so they will be lonely all their lives.  There is also a concern that some people will abuse the use of dating apps by pretending to be interested in long-term relationships but will hide such intentions. This again will ruin the relationship between the couples who are dating through dating apps. This has happened before. Because people do not trust each other, they are quick to believe their partner is having a love affair. As a result, they do many things to the suspects including stalking and monitoring cell phone activities. This will result in breaking up relationships and might lead to even divorce as a consequence. Thus, I think that technology worsen romantic interactions and should be wise.",user,21,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
