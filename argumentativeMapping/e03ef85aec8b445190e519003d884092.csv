The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we need to be even more cautious of our screen time now. he pandemic has made us more isolated and more vulnerable to the negative effects of screen time.
 e need to be more aware of our screen time and its effects on our health and well-being.
 There should be a national campaign to warn of these dangers. Too many of us use our screens all day, for work, school and social interaction that we need to unplug and live in the real world for a good portion of the day.   am not anti-screen. by any means, I am just aware of some of the dangers associated with prolonged screen time and think it should be more of a priority right now because of the drastic increases over the past year and a half. These new habbits and patterns we are forming have the potential to effect us for the rest of our lives. I worry that when the pandemic finally ends that a significant portion of society will not change. They will live on their devices for 15 hours a day. I worry that this will be the new normal. I already see huge pushes for office workers to continue working from home. Even businesses are opening up to it since it cuts down on operating costs. As long productivity does not take a big hit. Then we have new technologies like VR, AR and holograms that will reduce the need even more to be physically present. I also see these new technologies being much more addictive then phones and desktops. These are fully immersive technologies that are becoming very realistic very fast. As I said before I am not anti screen, I am just very worried for our future when it comes to personal interaction at school and the workplace. I also think there should be much more focus on the effects of screen time since we are using it more and more.",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
