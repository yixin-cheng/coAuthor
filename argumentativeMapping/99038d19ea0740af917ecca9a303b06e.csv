However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have  healthier and safer society",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society.

However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effectin the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.",user,17,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

The first thing to do is make sure that we would all survive in the years to come. And how we do that is to first combat climate change, a big thing that is already harming animals and plants on this planet, and look forward to caring for everyone and everything.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

The first thing to do is make sure that we would all survive in the years to come. And how we do that is to first combat climate change, a big thing that is already harming animals and plants on this planet, and look forward to caring for everyone and everything. We need to be empathetic and aware of our impact on the planet, and the impact of our actions worldwide in other humans, animals and ecosystems.",api,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

The first thing to do is make sure that we would all survive in the years to come. And how we do that is to first combat climate change, a big thing that is already harming animals and plants on this planet, and look forward to caring for everyone and everything. We need to be empathetic and aware of our impact on the planet, and the impact of our actions worldwide in other humans, animals and ecosystems. Because we are",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them.
