In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with BiFake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening. 

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world.

If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places.

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening. 

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening. If you don't stay u

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening. If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your c

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening. If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's 

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apath. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.   

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll beco 

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person from  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I accept that it is real and at least try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.",user,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world.

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.

If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed.

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world.

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden.

If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.

If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes we're able eventually, together,

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes we're able eventually, together, make the world a bette

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place.!

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and chose to no

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and  don't choose bl

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them them if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and  don't choose ap blindness!

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them ho if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and  don't choose apathy or blindness!

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them how they feel if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and  don't choose apathy or blindness!

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them how they feel about/ if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and  don't choose apathy or blindness!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?
