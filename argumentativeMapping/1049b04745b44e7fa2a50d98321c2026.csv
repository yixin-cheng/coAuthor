Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations.

I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

I do not think it is really ok to put animal suffering above human suffering though. Both are problems, and both should be addressed for sure. I do think that we should put more focus on human suffering though. Just because most of us do not have to deal with the bad treatment on a daily basis, doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to it.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

I do not think it is really ok to put animal suffering above human suffering though. Both are problems, and both should be addressed for sure. I do think that we should put more focus on human suffering though.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

I do not think it is really ok to put animal suffering above human suffering though. Both are problems, and both should be addressed for sure. I do think that we should put more focus on human suffering though. Just because most of us do not have to deal with the bad treatment on a daily basis, doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to it.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

I do not think it is really ok to put animal suffering above human suffering though. Both are problems, and both should be addressed for sure. I do think that we should put more focus on human suffering though. Just because most of us do not have to deal with the bad treatment on a daily basis, doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to it.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

I do not think it is really ok to put animal suffering above human suffering though. Both are problems, and both should be addressed for sure. I do think that we should put more focus on human suffering though. Just because most of us do not have to deal with the bad treatment on a daily basis, doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to it.
