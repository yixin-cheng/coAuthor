In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that.

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways.

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways.

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows.

I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows.

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad peopl",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.

I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.

Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that.

Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that.

All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.
 I have kids, and I know they don't even care about the news one little bit, unless it has something to do with video games of course. Just like all the other normal kids. i don't think they are bad ci",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways.

I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.
 I have kids, and I know they don't even care about the news one little bit, unless it has something to do with video games of course. Just like all the other normal kids. i don't think they are bad citizens. Many old folks do the same.",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.
 I have kids, and I know they don't even care about the news one little bit, unless it has something to do with video games of course.
