In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times.

I don't want to hear what they are listening to.

 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.
 With an audiobook, you have to hope you like the sound of the narrators voice. If you do, you are in good shape, if not, it can make for a long and arduous listen. It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times.

 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.

It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read. 
Finally, I can't lend an audiobook to a friend or family member as easily as a physical book. I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book.

 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times. I know I find it rude when someone in a waiting room or on public transportation is listening to an audiobook or something on their phone without headphones. It is like an invasion of my space. I don't want to hear what they are listening to. 
econd, you have to be able to listen to the book at a certain pace.
 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.
 With an audiobook, you have to hope you like the sound of the narrators voice. If you do, you are in good shape, if not, it can make for a long and arduous listen. It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read. 
Finally, I can't lend an audiobook to a friend or family member as easily as a physical book. I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times. I know I find it rude when someone in a waiting room or on public transportation is listening to an audiobook or something on their phone without headphones. It is like an invasion of my space. I don't want to hear what they are listening to. 
econd, you have to be able to listen to the book at a certain pace.
 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.
 With an audiobook, you have to hope you like the sound of the narrators voice. If you do, you are in good shape, if not, it can make for a long and arduous listen. It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read. 
Finally, I can't lend an audiobook to a friend or family member as easily as a physical book. I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book. I can just hand them the book and they can give it back when they are done. It gives me the pleasure of knowing I have shared something that I enjoy with someone hoping that they will enjoy it as well.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times. I know I find it rude when someone in a waiting room or on public transportation is listening to an audiobook or something on their phone without headphones. It is like an invasion of my space. I don't want to hear what they are listening to. 
econd, you have to be able to listen to the book at a certain pace.
 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.
 With an audiobook, you have to hope you like the sound of the narrators voice. If you do, you are in good shape, if not, it can make for a long and arduous listen. It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read. 
Finally, I can't lend an audiobook to a friend or family member as easily as a physical book. I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times. I know I find it rude when someone in a waiting room or on public transportation is listening to an audiobook or something on their phone without headphones. It is like an invasion of my space. I don't want to hear what they are listening to. 
econd, you have to be able to listen to the book at a certain pace.
 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.
 With an audiobook, you have to hope you like the sound of the narrators voice. If you do, you are in good shape, if not, it can make for a long and arduous listen. It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read. 
Finally, I can't lend an audiobook to a friend or family member as easily as a physical book. I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book.
