In my opinion, the decision about sports is a personal one.  The issue arises if you endanger others in pursuit of your sport.  If you are endangering people not involved, or if rescuers have to put their own safety at risk to aide you because of an accident, then I believe you have crossed a line.   n the other hand, if it is just your own risk and only your own choice to endanger yourself, I don't think that's necessarily
 a problem.  There are times when people go hiking and climbing in inclement weather and get stranded, In those cases rescue teams have to venture into the same danger, but they have not made that choice, aside from signing on to be a life saver.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, the decision about sports is a personal one.  The issue arises if you endanger others in pursuit of your sport.  If you are endangering people not involved, or if rescuers have to put their own safety at risk to aide you because of an accident, then I believe you have crossed a line.   n the other hand, if it is just your own risk and only your own choice to endanger yourself, I don't think that's necessarily

In my opinion, the decision about sports is a personal one.  The issue arises if you endanger others in pursuit of your sport.  If you are endangering people not involved, or if rescuers have to put their own safety at risk to aide you because of an accident, then I believe you have crossed a line.   n the other hand, if it is just your own risk and only your own choice to endanger yourself, I don't think that's necessarily

There are times when people go hiking and climbing in inclement weather and get stranded, In those cases rescue teams have to venture into the same danger, but they have not made that choice, aside from signing on to be a life saver.

In my opinion, the decision about sports is a personal one.  The issue arises if you endanger others in pursuit of your sport.  If you are endangering people not involved, or if rescuers have to put their own safety at risk to aide you because of an accident, then I believe you have crossed a line.   n the other hand, if it is just your own risk and only your own choice to endanger yourself, I don't think that's necessarily
