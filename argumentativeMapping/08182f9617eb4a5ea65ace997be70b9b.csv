In my opinion, college athletes should be paid, but not any more than college students in other parts of faculty. There should be a limit on how much the athletes can be paid while enrolled in classes. However, I feel that they should be entitled to royalties on anything particularly made of themselves. The athletes should have to conform to some kind of code of conduct as to not do anything that would tarnish the positive effect they could have over the public. In addition, the coaches should have to follow a code of conduct as well. This means not doing anything that could be considered unethical including coercion of teachers to give the appropriate grades needed to fulfill academic requirements. College athletes should be protected from getting exploited much the same way child models are being protected, as well as their implications for their future job opportunities.
