Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.
It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.
It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.
It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.

It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

People appear more empathetic to animals because they are generally easier to love and that they respond physically to their owners.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.

It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

People appear more empathetic to animals because they are generally easier to love and that they respond physically to their owners.

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.

It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

People appear more empathetic to animals because they are generally easier to love and that they respond physically to their owners.

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with putting animal welfare among our concerns, but it should not in any case hinder our concern for our fellow humans as well. Focusing only on animal welfare will only be wrong if we do not also focus on human welfare.

It would not be surprising to see the results of a study wherein  a dog being beaten would gather more sympathy over a human being similarly beaten, in that, a dog would not be expected to be able defend itself compared to a human.  On the study where a person would save their pet over a foreign tourist, the behavior would also be expected, as most pet owners considers their pets not as mere animals but as family members and that when faced with a difficult situation, a person would always prioritize a family member over a stranger, only in this case, it is their pet that is the family member.

People appear more empathetic to animals because they are generally easier to love and that they respond physically to their owners.
