The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Th",user,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits.

This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters.

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters.

This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters.

I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters.

I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits.

I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes. I think many shows, books, and other forms of content will continue to improve in how it depicts its characters, with more content like it becoming mor",user,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes. I think many shows, books, and other forms of content will continue to improve in how it depicts its characters, with more content like it becoming more numerous and widespread.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes.

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes. I think many shows, books, and other forms of content will continue to improve in how it depicts its characters, with more content like it becoming more numerous and widespread.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world.
