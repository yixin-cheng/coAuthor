In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes.",user,18,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed.

The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyl",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified s",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified salary cap should be given to a charity that helps those in need.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes.

I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to.

Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified salary cap should be given to a charity that helps those in need.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified salary cap should be given to a charity that helps those in need.

Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified salary cap should be given to a charity that helps those in need.

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes.
