Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

Hardcover books don't hurt my ears, and I don't have to worry about recharging my batteries. I already have enough electronic items, that I don't need anything else to get a virus, glitch, or need chargin

 think the only advantage to listening to an audiobook is that you can do other things while you're listening.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

Hardcover books don't hurt my ears, and I don't have to worry about recharging my batteries. I already have enough electronic items, that I don't need anything else to get a virus, glitch, or need charging. 

 think the only advantage to listening to an audiobook is that you can do other things while you're listening.
 You can walk, drive, or do housework while you're listening. You can't do that with a book.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.

 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

Hardcover books don't hurt my ears, and I don't have to worry about recharging my batteries. I already have enough electronic items, that I don't need anything else to get a virus, glitch, or need charging.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

 think the only advantage to listening to an audiobook is that you can do other things while you're listening.

I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.

Hardcover books don't hurt my ears, and I don't have to worry about an apathetic, sleepy, or nasal narrator. I already have enough electronic items, that I don't need anything else to get a virus, glitch, or need charging. 

 think the only advantage to listening to an audiobook is that you can do other things while you're listening.
 You can walk, drive, or do housework while you're listening. You can't do that with a book.

I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning if I have questions. R

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the illustrations,.
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning if I have questions. Reading a real book appeals to my ADHD.

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the illustrations, diagrams, and author's notes. I can skip to the back for a quick timeline or genealogy. 
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters.
