There are risks involved in all sports—if you decide it's too dangerous and don't participate, then that's OK. But if you are going to participate, you should know what risks there are.

If an activity is putting people in a position where they are forced to engage in it by the government or a governing athletic organization, then I
 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their f punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, as long as the activity in question is reasonably regulated and you choose to participate knowing the risks, then it should not be called too dangerous to be considered a sport. There are risks involved in all sports—if you decide it's too dangerous and don't participate, then that's OK. But if you are going to participate, you should know what risks there are.

If an activity is putting people in a position where they are forced to engage in it by the government or a governing athletic organization, then I
 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation.

 From 1997 to 2002, fatalities averaged nearly one fatality every two weeks. The average BASE jumper has a nearly 50 percent likelihood of dying or being seriously injured over the course of a lifetime of jumping. So why do people continue to jump? Some jumpers say it is for the thrill, others because they value the freedom of parachuting on their own terms and don't want to be encumbered by gravity, and others simply want to experience flight without a plane. 
I contend that these are good reasons and enough to support this activity as a sport.
   In fact, one could argue that the seriousness of the risk makes it more fun and adventurous to many people. If BASE jumping were as safe as golf, there wouldn't be the attraction for some to give it a try.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, as long as the activity in question is reasonably regulated and you choose to participate knowing the risks, then it should not be called too dangerous to be considered a sport. There are risks involved in all sports—if you decide it's too dangerous and don't participate, then that's OK. But if you are going to participate, you should know what risks there are.

If an activity is putting people in a position where they are forced to engage in it by the government or a governing athletic organization, then I
 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.

In my opinion, as long as the activity in question is reasonably regulated and you choose to participate knowing the risks, then it should not be called too dangerous to be considered a sport. There are risks involved in all sports—if you decide it's too dangerous and don't participate, then that's OK. But if you are going to participate, you should know what risks there are. I would much rather experience a risky sport, co, than never have had the opportunity to do something that sometimes pushes me to my limits

If an activity is putting people in a position where they are forced to engage in it by the government or a governing athletic organization, then I
 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation. 

et's take a look at the reality of a dangerous sport like BASE jumping.
 From 1997 to 2002, fatalities averaged nearly one fatality every two weeks. The average BASE jumper has a nearly 50 percent likelihood of dying or being seriously injured over the course of a lifetime of jumping. So why do people continue to jump? Some jumpers say it is for the thrill, others because they value the freedom of parachuting on their own terms and don't want to be encumbered by gravity, and others simply want to experience flight without a plane. 
I contend that these are good reasons and enough to support this activity as a sport.
   In fact, one could argue that the seriousness of the risk makes it more fun and adventurous to many people. If BASE jumping were as safe as golf, there wouldn't be the attraction for some to give it a try. 
So is it selfish to participate in risky sports?
 That depends on how you want to look at it. I believe you need to make an informed choice and understand the risks. Be smart about it, but don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and desires. ",user,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

If an activity is putting people in a position where they are forced to engage in it by the government or a governing athletic organization, then I
 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation. 

et's take a look at the reality of a dangerous sport like BASE jumping.
 From 1997 to 2002, fatalities averaged nearly one fatality every two weeks. The average BASE jumper has a nearly 50 percent likelihood of dying or being seriously injured over the course of a lifetime of jumping. So why do people continue to jump? Some jumpers say it is for the thrill, others because they value the freedom of parachuting on their own terms and don't want to be encumbered by gravity, and others simply want to experience flight without a plane. 
I contend that these are good reasons and enough to support this activity as a sport.
   In fact, one could argue that the seriousness of the risk makes it more fun and adventurous to many people. If BASE jumping were as safe as golf, there wouldn't be the attraction for some to give it a try.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation. 

et's take a look at the reality of a dangerous sport like BASE jumping.
 From 1997 to 2002, fatalities averaged nearly one fatality every two weeks. The average BASE jumper has a nearly 50 percent likelihood of dying or being seriously injured over the course of a lifetime of jumping. So why do people continue to jump? Some jumpers say it is for the thrill, others because they value the freedom of parachuting on their own terms and don't want to be encumbered by gravity, and others simply want to experience flight without a plane. 
I contend that these are good reasons and enough to support this activity as a sport.
   In fact, one could argue that the seriousness of the risk makes it more fun and adventurous to many people. If BASE jumping were as safe as golf, there wouldn't be the attraction for some to give it a try. 
So is it selfish to participate in risky sports?
 That depends on how you want to look at it. I believe you need to make an informed choice and understand the risks. Be smart about it, but don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and desires. ",user,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

 have a problem with it. Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation. 

et's take a look at the reality of a dangerous sport like BASE jumping.
 From 1997 to 2002, fatalities averaged nearly one fatality every two weeks. The average BASE jumper has a nearly 50 percent likelihood of dying or being seriously injured over the course of a lifetime of jumping. So why do people continue to jump? Some jumpers say it is for the thrill, others because they value the freedom of parachuting on their own terms and don't want to be encumbered by gravity, and others simply want to experience flight without a plane. 
I contend that these are good reasons and enough to support this activity as a sport.
   In fact, one could argue that the seriousness of the risk makes it more fun and adventurous to many people. If BASE jumping were as safe as golf, there wouldn't be the attraction for some to give it a try. 
So is it selfish to participate in risky sports?
 That depends on how you want to look at it. I believe you need to make an informed choice and understand the risks. Be smart about it, but don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and desires. ",user,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, as long as the activity in question is reasonably regulated and you choose to participate knowing the risks, then it should not be called too dangerous to be considered a sport. There are risks involved in all sports—if you decide it's too dangerous and don't participate, then that's OK. But if you are going to participate, you should know what risks there are.
