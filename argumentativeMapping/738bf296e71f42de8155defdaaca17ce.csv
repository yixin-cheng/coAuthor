In my opinion, one of the most important things that I learned in school was that nothing that happened in school mattered after graduation. I learned that the only thing that matters is what you do after school. For much of my childhood, I was the victim of a lot of bullying and teasing.  Then in my teens, I lost a lot of weight and was no longer the subject of their jokes and insults. I was still the same person, but they didn't know that.  However, I soon realized after graduation, all of this didn't matter at all.

In my opinion, one of the most important things that I learned in school was that nothing that happened in school mattered after graduation. I learned that the only thing that matters is what you do after school. For much of my childhood, I was the victim of a lot of bullying and teasing.  Then in my teens, I lost a lot of weight and was no longer the subject of their jokes and insults. I was still the same person, but they didn't know that.  However, I soon realized after graduation, all of this didn't matter at all.

The day after I took off that cap and gown, my life started over.  I was exposed to a complete new world with new people at college.  It was a fresh start. I made new friends with people that had no idea about what happened to me in high school or even before then.  I was able to start over and be the person that I wanted to be.

I learned that the only thing that matters is what you do after school. For much of my childhood, I was the victim of a lot of bullying and teasing.

However, I soon realized after graduation, all of this didn't matter at all.
