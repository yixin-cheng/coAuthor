In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.

They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.

Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.

It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

Ideally, I want to engage with media that shows African-Americans in a more positive light.  I would like to see more portrayals of intelligent, calculating Afr",user,14,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

Ideally, I want to engage with media that shows African-Americans in a more positive light.  I would like to see more portrayals of intelligent, calculating African-American characters.  I would like to see more African-American characters who are portrayed as being independent and not needing the help of other characters.  ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

Ideally, I want to engage with media that shows African-Americans in a more positive light.  I would like to see more portrayals of intelligent, calculating African-American characters.

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

Ideally, I want to engage with media that shows African-Americans in a more positive light.  I would like to see more portrayals of intelligent, calculating African-American characters.  I would like to see more African-American characters who are portrayed as being independent and not needing the help of other characters.

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.
