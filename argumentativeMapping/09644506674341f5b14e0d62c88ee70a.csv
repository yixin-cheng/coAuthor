Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.

This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to pr",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.   I think products like toilet paper are different because they are often cheaper to buy.   ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position. 

Ultimately, schools number one focus should be education.  If these schools have to divert their time to other non-education areas, I believe this will harm the school's ability to educate.  Schools should pass off the responsiblity o",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position.

This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position. 

Ultimately, schools number one focus should be education.  If these schools have to divert their time to other non-education areas, I believe this will harm the school's ability to educate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?
