How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, every middle and high school should have these dispensers in the girl's bathrooms. Even in elementary schools, there should be some kept in the clinic just in case. Leave them in the bathrooms like you would toilet paper or soap. They are a disposable, vital, hygiene product. This should not be a funding issues because they are extremely cheap and can be bought even cheaper wholesale. I have a feeling the school boards could negotiate some great deals with huge suppliers. 
Enough about the financial aspect, lets discuss the personal aspects of this situation. I am a man so it is hard for me to fully relate but I can only imagine if my rear end started bleeding in class and everybody saw it. I would be horrified. The emotional toll that can take on a child or young adult can be life changing.
