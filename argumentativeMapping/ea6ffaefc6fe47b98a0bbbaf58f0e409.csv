In my opinion,  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion,  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students. In my opinion, free stuff from school should be provided equally to all the students, but not a portion of it. But if a student has financial difficulty, they may ask the school for financial help in order to get enough supply of pads and tampons. Supplying the sanitary stuff free to financially constrained students sound more acceptable than providing them to all the female students, as they are not similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion,  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students. In my opinion, free stuff from school should be provided equally to all the students, but not a portion of it. But if a student has financial difficulty, they may ask the school for financial help in order to get enough supply of pads and tampons. Supplying the sanitary stuff free to financially constrained students sound more acceptable than providing them to all the female students, as they are not similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion,  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students. In my opinion, free stuff from school should be provided equally to all the students, but not a portion of it. But if a student has financial difficulty, they may ask the school for financial help in order to get enough supply of pads and tampons. Supplying the sanitary stuff free to financially constrained students sound more acceptable than providing them to all the female students, as they are not similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools.

text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion,  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students. In my opinion, free stuff from school should be provided equally to all the students, but not a portion of it. But if a student has financial difficulty, they may ask the school for financial help in order to get enough supply of pads and tampons. Supplying the sanitary stuff free to financially constrained students sound more acceptable than providing them to all the female students, as they are not similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. In addition, students in poverty can apply for government aids to satisfy their daily needs including getting those sanitary stuff. To con",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
