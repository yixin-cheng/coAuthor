In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.   People in the past considered sports to be things like bullfighting and gladiator fighting; things that many would consider reckless by today's standards.  Hunting, fishing, javelin-throwing and archery all involved substantial risk.

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.   People in the past considered sports to be things like bullfighting and gladiator fighting; things that many would consider reckless by today's standards.

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.   People in the past considered sports to be things like bullfighting and gladiator fighting; things that many would consider reckless by today's standards.  Hunting, fishing, javelin-throwing and archery all involved substantial risk.  

Ask a person from the early 1900's what sports are and they would probably say boxing, horseback riding, or hiking and skiing.  Teddy Roosevelt engaged in the ""sport"" of big game hunting and one of his companions was killed by wildlife during one of his hunting ""safaris."" 

When one calls a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport, they are effectively ruling out many of man's favorite pursuits throughout time. Each person has their own definition of risk.
