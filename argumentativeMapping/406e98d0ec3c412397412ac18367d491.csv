Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.

I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools.

They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.

I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair.

I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair. 

And honestly, the inequality McDavis describes in his article is a prerequisite to having college sports at all.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is false. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is entirely wron. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coached in luxury jets to visit potential athletes and wave the promises of success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair. 

And honestly, the inequality McDavis describes in his article is a prerequisite to having college sports at all.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is entirely wrong. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coaches in luxury jets to visit potential athletes, wave promises of future success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.
It's not that the college sports system is egalitarian and paying players would create inequality.
 Rather, the problem is that the current system is already unfair. 

And honestly, the inequality McDavis describes in his article is a prerequisite to having college sports at all.
