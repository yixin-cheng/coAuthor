There are a lot of great things about audiobooks.
 The obvious perk is that you can enjoy a book on the go, in the car, or while walking. This is a great benefit, especially when you think of how much time we spend in the car or on public transportation. 

Audiobooks are more ecofriendly. Since they are digital, you don’t need books to be manufactured, stored, and transported. There is also less book waste. Regular books can mold, mildew, and spoil, but audiobooks are forever.

Audiobooks can be used in environments that would damage regular books. They are be listened to at the beach, where regular pages would get sandy or wet.  They can be used when cooking, when your floury hands wouldn't be able to turn a page. 
I feel like I am free to do other things while listening to an audiobook, like rcook clean, or cdo household chores
 I don’t need to focus on a story as much as I would with physical books. I can daydream and do other activities.

There are a lot of great things about audiobooks.
 The obvious perk is that you can enjoy a book on the go, in the car, or while walking. This is a great benefit, especially when you think of how much time we spend in the car or on public transportation. 

Audiobooks are more ecofriendly. Since they are digital, you don’t need books to be manufactured, stored, and transported. There is also less book waste. Regular books can mold, mildew, and spoil, but audiobooks are forever.

Audiobooks can be used in environments that would damage regular books. They are be listened to at the beach, where regular pages would get sandy or wet.  They can be used when cooking, when your floury hands wouldn't be able to turn a page. 
I feel like I am free to do other things while listening to an audiobook, like rcook clean, or cdo household chores
 I don’t need to focus on a story as much as I would with physical books. I can daydream and do other activities. 

t’s also nice not to have to sit still.
 I feel like I can consume a book while running on the treadmill, or in other places where it’s hard to sit.  
I can be energized by hearing a motivational book while working out.

There are a lot of great things about audiobooks.
 The obvious perk is that you can enjoy a book on the go, in the car, or while walking. This is a great benefit, especially when you think of how much time we spend in the car or on public transportation. 

Audiobooks are more ecofriendly. Since they are digital, you don’t need books to be manufactured, stored, and transported. There is also less book waste. Regular books can mold, mildew, and spoil, but audiobooks are forever.

Audiobooks can be used in environments that would damage regular books. They are be listened to at the beach, where regular pages would get sandy or wet.  They can be used when cooking, when your floury hands wouldn't be able to turn a page. 
I feel like I am free to do other things while listening to an audiobook, like rcook clean, or cdo household chores
 I don’t need to focus on a story as much as I would with physical books. I can daydream and do other activities.

I love listening to audiobooks, and they are a part of my weekly routine. With my commute, I listen to a lot of books, and I can’t imagine giving that up. 
There are a lot of great things about audiobooks.
 The obvious perk is that you can enjoy a book on the go, in the car, or while walking. This is a great benefit, especially when you think of how much time we spend in the car or on public transportation. 

Audiobooks are more ecofriendly. Since they are digital, you don’t need books to be manufactured, stored, and transported. There is also less book waste. Regular books can mold, mildew, and spoil, but audiobooks are forever.

Audiobooks can be used in environments that would damage regular books. They are be listened to at the beach, where regular pages would get sandy or wet.  They can be used when cooking, when your floury hands wouldn't be able to turn a page. 
I feel like I am free to do other things while listening to an audiobook, like rcook clean, or cdo household chores
 I don’t need to focus on a story as much as I would with physical books. I can daydream and do other activities. 

t’s also nice not to have to sit still.
 I feel like I can consume a book while running on the treadmill, or in other places where it’s hard to sit.  
I can be energized by hearing a motivational book while working out. 

I listen to books when I am in bed at night. It’s my time to unwind and give my brain some time off after the chaos of the day. And, thanks to technology, I can keep the volume low while falling asleep. 

Audiobooks have many advantages, and their flexibility makes them valuable
