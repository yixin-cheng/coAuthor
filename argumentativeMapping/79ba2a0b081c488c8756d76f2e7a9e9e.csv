Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders.

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders.

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals.

If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders.

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life.

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life. The death of a human is more serious than that of animal. For example, the death of a great sc",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life. The death of a human is more serious than that of animal. For example, the death of a great scientist will cause a",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life. The death of a human is more serious than that of animal. For example, the death of a great scientist will cause a huge loss to the socie",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life.

I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life. The death of a human is more serious than that of animal. For example, the death of a great scientist will cause a huge loss to the society because of their outstanding contribution to",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life. The death of a human is more serious than that of animal. For example, the death of a great scientist will cause a huge loss to the society because of their outstanding contribution to the society. However, the death of a dog will not cause any loss to the society.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?
