IPeople are smart in their own ways. I have seen many people who are not the smartest in school, but they are very intelligent in other ways. They are very good at sports or art. They are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend.
I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people., while only using one metric of intelligence.  There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it. ",user,7,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

They are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend. Intelligence does not equal worth.  People can make real and valuable contributions even if they don't understand advanced calculus. 
I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people., while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it. ",user,7,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it.

The character is usually a female and she is portrayed as being unintelligent. She is usually a cheerleader or a popular girl. Her lack of experience in math, the sciences is used as a punchline, her only worth her stereotypically beautiful body.

I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people, while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
IPeople are smart in their own ways. I have seen many people who are not the smartest in school, but they are very intelligent in other ways. They are very good at sports or art. They are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend. Intelligence does not equal worth.  People can make real and valuable contributions even if they don't understand advanced calculus. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the ""dumb blonde"" or ""dumb brunette."" I have seen this stereotype in many movies and television shows. The character is usually a female and she is portrayed as being unintelligent. She is usually a cheerleader or a popular girl. Her lack of experience in math, the sciences is used as a punchline, her only worth her stereotypically beautiful body.

I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people, while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
IPeople are smart in their own ways. I have seen many people who are not the smartest in school, but they are very intelligent in other ways. They are very good at sports or art. They are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend. Intelligence does not equal worth.  People can make real and valuable contributions even if they don't understand advanced calculus. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the ""dumb blonde"" or ""dumb brunette."" I have seen this stereotype in many movies and television shows. The character is usually a female and she is portrayed as being unintelligent. She is usually a cheerleader or a popular girl. Her lack of experience in math, the sciences is used as a punchline, her only worth her stereotypically beautiful body.

I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people, while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
IPeople are smart in their own ways. I have seen many people who are not the smartest in school, but they are very intelligent in other ways. They are very good at sports or art. They are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend. Intelligence does not equal worth.  People can make real and valuable contributions even if they don't understand advanced calculus. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the ""dumb blonde"" or ""dumb brunette."" I have seen this stereotype in many movies and television shows. The character is usually a female and she is portrayed as being unintelligent. She is usually a cheerleader or a popular girl. Her lack of experience in math, the sciences is used as a punchline, her only worth her stereotypically beautiful body.

I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people, while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only one manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
IPeople are smart in their own ways. I have seen many people who are not the smartest in school, but they are very intelligent in other ways. They are very good at sports or art. They can be aThey are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend. Intelligence does not equal worth.  People can make real and valuable contributions even if they don't understand advanced calculus. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the ""dumb blonde"" or ""dumb brunette."" I have seen this stereotype in many movies and television shows. The character is usually a female and she is portrayed as being unintelligent. She is usually a cheerleader or a popular girl. Her lack of experience in math, the sciences is used as a punchline, her only worth her stereotypically beautiful body.

I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people, while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only one manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn.
