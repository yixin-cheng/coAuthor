But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram.

At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media.

Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far mm",user,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bo",user,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media.

Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to.

Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

To reiterate, none of this is a surprise: I see the pandemic as just another, albeit excruciating way of speeding up society's inevitable digital transformation. So I say, we accept that, and along with all th",user,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office.

Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

To reiterate, none of this is a surprise: I see the pandemic as just another, albeit excruciating way of speeding up society's inevitable digital transformation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

To reiterate, none of this is a surprise: I see the pandemic as just another, albeit excruciating way of speeding up society's inevitable digital transformation. So I say, we accept that, and along with all the terrible hardships brought about by the pandemic, acknowledge the fact tha",user,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

To reiterate, none of this is a surprise: I see the pandemic as just another, albeit excruciating way of speeding up society's inevitable digital transformation. So I say, we accept that, and along with all the terrible hardships brought about by the pandemic, acknowledge the fact that it's brought u",user,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

To reiterate, none of this is a surprise: I see the pandemic as just another, albeit excruciating way of speeding up society's inevitable digital transformation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?
