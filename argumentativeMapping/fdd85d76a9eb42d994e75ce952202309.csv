In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it.

But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes.

At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks!

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks!

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks!

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks!

Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks! All in all, there are far more advantages than disadvantages to audiobooks over traditional books and that is why I prefer them.",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
