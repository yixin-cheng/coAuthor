Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.

 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true.

I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.

I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see.

I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see.

 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is.

I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role.

I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs.

Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time.

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs.

Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.

Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is.

They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time. 

Hollywood thrives on making money and if something is working for them they will continue to produce it. I guess the movies with negative sterotypes of minorities must be money makers.

Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see.

Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time. 

Hollywood thrives on making money and if something is working for them they will continue to produce it. I guess the movies with negative sterotypes of minorities must be money makers. What if they weren't any longer? Would that cause the writers to think outside the box and see the world as it really is and not as it has been in their skewed minds.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.

Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time. 

Hollywood thrives on making money and if something is working for them they will continue to produce it. I guess the movies with negative sterotypes of minorities must be money makers. What if they weren't any longer? Would that cause the writers to think outside the box and see the world as it really is and not as it has been in their skewed minds.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time. 

Hollywood thrives on making money and if something is working for them they will continue to produce it. I guess the movies with negative stereotypes of minorities must be money makers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else.

When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else.
