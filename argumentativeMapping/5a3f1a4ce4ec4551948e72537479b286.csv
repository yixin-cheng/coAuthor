Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, providing free pads and tampons should be as normal as providing toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other essentials in schools. Students should not be put at a disadvantage in school because of their home life, whether socio-economic, cultural or just how prepared parents send their kids to school.   Providing pads and tampons to students ultimately helps to give everyone an even playing field at school.  School can be hard enough for students, especially the older ones, and removing this, potential, problem that could lead to embarrassment and stigma will only improve the learning experience.  The price of doing this would be minimal, and the potential benefits greatly out weigh that costs.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, providing free pads and tampons should be as normal as providing toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other essentials in schools. Students should not be put at a disadvantage in school because of their home life, whether socio-economic, cultural or just how prepared parents send their kids to school.   Providing pads and tampons to students ultimately helps to give everyone an even playing field at school.  School can be hard enough for students, especially the older ones, and removing this, potential, problem that could lead to embarrassment and stigma will only improve the learning experience.  The price of doing this would be minimal, and the potential benefits greatly out weigh that costs.  To me, there is little, if any,  downside to this debate, some might argue that it is the responsibility of the parents to provide these resources, but this ignores that fact of the situation, that many girls go to school unprepared.   It is a well documented fact that many homes are unable to provide these and other necessities for students, and it should be the job of the school to do so.
