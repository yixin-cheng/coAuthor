In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice.

Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford.

Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants.

Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community.

The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.
 That is why we vote. We vote with the interest of the community, as a whole, in mind. That is the only responsible way to make those choices. Otherwise, there is no limit to the freedom an individual might want to claim. They may claim that they can choose to hurt other people, however indirectly, in pursuit of their own goals.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community.

Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.
 That is why we vote. We vote with the interest of the community, as a whole, in mind. That is the only responsible way to make those choices. Otherwise, there is no limit to the freedom an individual might want to claim. They may claim that they can choose to hurt other people, however indirectly, in pursuit of their own goals.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.
 That is why we vote. We vote with the interest of the community, as a whole, in mind. That is the only responsible way to make those choices. Otherwise, there is no limit to the freedom an individual might want to claim. They may claim that they can choose to hurt other people, however indirectly, in pursuit of their own goals. That is wrong. It is not a meaningful expression of freedom. That is an attack on the institutions that allow us to live freely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice.
