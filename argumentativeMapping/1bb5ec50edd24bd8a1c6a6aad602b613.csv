Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

In my opinion, both listening to audiobooks, and reading are are good, each offering benefits.  One method maybe be better than the other in a specific situation, but overall, each contributes to  education, learning, and entertainment in a unique, but equally beneficial fashion.
I listen to audiobooks when I'm doing something else, like driving, walking, or working out.
   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. 

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, without getting stimulated or needing an electronic device like an audioboo

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

In my opinion, both listening to audiobooks, and reading are are good, each offering benefits.  One method maybe be better than the other in a specific situation, but overall, each contributes to  education, learning, and entertainment in a unique, but equally beneficial fashion.
I listen to audiobooks when I'm doing something else, like driving, walking, or working out.
   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. 

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbwithout getting stimulated or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   TherI feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence andI feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership thatI feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. 

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilaratioI feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

In my opinion, both listening to audiobooks, and reading are are good, each offering benefits.  One method maybe be better than the other in a specific situation, but overall, each contributes to  education, learning, and entertainment in a unique, but equally beneficial fashion.
I listen to audiobooks when I'm doing something else, like driving, walking, or working out.
   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. 

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilarating. I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I  love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, crushinor charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

In my opinion, both listening to audiobooks, and reading are are good, each offering benefits.  One method maybe be better than the other in a specific situation, but overall, each mecontributes to education, learning, and entertainment in a unique, but equally beneficial fashion.
I listen to audiobooks when I'm doing something else, like driving, walking, or working out.
   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. 

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilarating. I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I  love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, crushing a screen, or charging a battery.

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I  love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, crushing a screen, or charging a battery.

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilarating. I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks.
