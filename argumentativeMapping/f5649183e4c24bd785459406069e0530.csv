The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, embrace it.  It has become a necessity so there is no point in having guilt, etc. about it.  At some point things will change and our behaviors will be more balanced.

Just think how up the creek without a paddle we would have been if we hadn't had the accessibility to screens and all the things they make possible.  Remote work would have been mostly impossible for many.  Online shopping impossible.  Keeping up with others would have involved long periods of delay and intimacy would have suffered.  Schooling would have been limited to what is in a book with no ready explanations or fun games to assist.   Doctor visits would have been only by phone with no opportunity for a more finely tuned diagnosis in many instances.

I think we are in a time of transition.  There should be and will be a balance as things normalize once again but screens are here to stay.  Perhaps we are just concerned about change, change in the way we work, relate to others, conduct ourselves.  Who among us has not just gussied up from the waist up for a Zoom call, skipping a shower and matching socks?  We need to establish new norms of behavior.  We need to be more flexible,  adaptable and accepting.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, embrace it.  It has become a necessity so there is no point in having guilt, etc. about it.  At some point things will change and our behaviors will be more balanced.

Just think how up the creek without a paddle we would have been if we hadn't had the accessibility to screens and all the things they make possible.  Remote work would have been mostly impossible for many.  Online shopping impossible.  Keeping up with others would have involved long periods of delay and intimacy would have suffered.  Schooling would have been limited to what is in a book with no ready explanations or fun games to assist.   Doctor visits would have been only by phone with no opportunity for a more finely tuned diagnosis in many instances.

I think we are in a time of transition.  There should be and will be a balance as things normalize once again but screens are here to stay.  Perhaps we are just concerned about change, change in the way we work, relate to others, conduct ourselves.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, embrace it.  It has become a necessity so there is no point in having guilt, etc. about it.  At some point things will change and our behaviors will be more balanced.

Just think how up the creek without a paddle we would have been if we hadn't had the accessibility to screens and all the things they make possible.  Remote work would have been mostly impossible for many.  Online shopping impossible.  Keeping up with others would have involved long periods of delay and intimacy would have suffered.  Schooling would have been limited to what is in a book with no ready explanations or fun games to assist.   Doctor visits would have been only by phone with no opportunity for a more finely tuned diagnosis in many instances.

I think we are in a time of transition.  There should be and will be a balance as things normalize once again but screens are here to stay.  Perhaps we are just concerned about change, change in the way we work, relate to others, conduct ourselves.  Who among us has not just gussied up from the waist up for a Zoom call, skipping a shower and matching socks?  We need to establish new norms of behavior.  We need to be more flexible,  adaptable and accepting.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, embrace it.  It has become a necessity so there is no point in having guilt, etc. about it.  At some point things will change and our behaviors will be more balanced.

Just think how up the creek without a paddle we would have been if we hadn't had the accessibility to screens and all the things they make possible.  Remote work would have been mostly impossible for many.  Online shopping impossible.  Keeping up with others would have involved long periods of delay and intimacy would have suffered.  Schooling would have been limited to what is in a book with no ready explanations or fun games to assist.   Doctor visits would have been only by phone with no opportunity for a more finely tuned diagnosis in many instances.

I think we are in a time of transition.  There should be and will be a balance as things normalize once again but screens are here to stay.  Perhaps we are just concerned about change, change in the way we work, relate to others, conduct ourselves.
