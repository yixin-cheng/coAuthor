Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, I think that if college athletes are paid, the spirit of sports might be ruined. If college athletes are paid, they will be more concerned about the money than the game or the team.  Also, if college athletes are paid, they will be more likely to cheat. Fairness of the game is therefore jeopardized. In addition, if college athletes are paid, they will be more likely to leave school early. College athletes are supposed to be students, not professional players. Their first priority should be the academic performance. Being paid to pay sports will distract the students from focusing on their academic, thus ruining the ultimate purpose of attending college.
