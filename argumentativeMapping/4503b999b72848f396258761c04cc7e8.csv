In my opinion, there are many benefits to audiobooks. Many people are on the go with limited free time. Audiobooks enable people to listen to books while working on other projects. Also, audiobooks can be especially good for students and children, who can listen on the way to/from school or while playing outside.

There is a sense of progress and oneness while reading a physical book that is a bit lost when you can't literally feel the number of pages thinning as you race towards the end. There are many small lessons a book reader innately absorbs about language arts, too. Book readers--via exposure--are almost certainly better spellers, with an elevated sense of what's possible with vocabulary, sentence structure, and when to use different punctuation marks.

Also, audiobooks can be especially good for students and children, who can listen on the way to/from school or while playing outside.

There is a sense of progress and oneness while reading a physical book that is a bit lost when you can't literally feel the number of pages thinning as you race towards the end. There are many small lessons a book reader innately absorbs about language arts, too. Book readers--via exposure--are almost certainly better spellers, with an elevated sense of what's possible with vocabulary, sentence structure, and when to use different punctuation marks.

There are many small lessons a book reader innately absorbs about language arts, too.

There is a sense of progress and oneness while reading a physical book that is a bit lost when you can't literally feel the number of pages thinning as you race towards the end. There are many small lessons a book reader innately absorbs about language arts, too. Book readers--via exposure--are almost certainly better spellers, with an elevated sense of what's possible with vocabulary, sentence structure, and when to use different punctuation marks. A person also has to simultaneously conceptualize the scene in their mind and picture it in their head while reading. People do this to some extent with audiobooks, but the audio will play on even while the listener has mentally begun to daydream. Book readers have a natural advantage here, too, where if their mind begins to drift, they simply cease progressing through the story, and can pick right back up where they left off.
