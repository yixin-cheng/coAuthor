Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action.

Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action.

Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care. 

Why do some people participate in extreme sports? There is more than one answer to this question. Some people are adreneline junkies and look for extreme sports to feel that high. Others need to prove something about being fearless and brave, which is sad.  To what degree does one take risk?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action.

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action.

Others need to prove something about being fearless and brave, which is sad.  To what degree does one take risk? This depends on age, ability and perceived danger.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care. 

Why do some people participate in extreme sports? There is more than one answer to this question. Some people are adreneline junkies and look for extreme sports to feel that high. Others need to prove something about being fearless and brave, which is sad.  To what degree does one take risk? This depends on age, ability and perceived danger.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care. 

Why do some people participate in extreme sports? There is more than one answer to this question. Some people are adreneline junkies and look for extreme sports to feel that high. Others need to prove something about being fearless and brave, which is sad.  To what degree does one take risk? This depends on age, ability and perceived danger.

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action.

Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care. 

Why do some people participate in extreme sports? There is more than one answer to this question. Some people are adreneline junkies and look for extreme sports to feel that high.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care. 

Why do some people participate in extreme sports? There is more than one answer to this question. Some people are adreneline junkies and look for extreme sports to feel that high. Others need to prove something about being fearless and brave, which is sad.  To what degree does one take risk? This depends on age, ability and perceived danger.
