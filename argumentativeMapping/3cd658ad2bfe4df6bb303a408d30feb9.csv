In my opinion, we must embrace the increased use for the time being but still be cautious of our usage. We still need to keep a balance, just less of one right now since so much of our lives can be run from home using all the different communication devices and services. 
IOverall though,  think we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices and use them to their fullest.
 We must be very mindful of our children's but adults should probably try to be as productive as possible using these technologies. We just need to keep ourselves focused on our goals and limit our fun time if or when it starts to hurt our productivity and/or personal relationships. We should also be using this time to explore new digital tools and expand our skill sets. Screen time in one form or another will eventually become an all day even when we start using augmented reality  or virtual reality.
