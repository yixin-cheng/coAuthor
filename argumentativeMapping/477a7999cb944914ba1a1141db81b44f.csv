Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis.

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and golf, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains o from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.",user,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minorserious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.",user,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chroserious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.",user,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motioserious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.",user,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing comp",user,13,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if t",user,13,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if that were to occur, many just as dangerous (or even more so) existing sports would need to be banned, in addition to any sports that could be considered too extreme, just because",user,13,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis.

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if that were to occur, many just as dangerous (or even more so) existing sports would need to be banned as well,  which w",user,13,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if that were to occur, many just as dangerous (or even more so) existing sports would need to be banned as well,  which would lead to very few sports in which an athlete could compete.",user,13,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
