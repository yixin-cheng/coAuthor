We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed.

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls.

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored.

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up. I am willing to bet that more money is spent on toliet paper then math and science classes. I dont know that for a fact but my gut never lies. Kids lie though, they cheat, steal and cause trouble with everything they have at their disposal. So why would we give them more things to cause trouble with?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up. I am willing to bet that more money is spent on toliet paper then math and science classes. I dont know that for a fact but my gut never lies. Kids lie though, they cheat, steal and cause trouble with everything they have at their disposal. So why would we give them more things to cause trouble with?

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up. I am willing to bet that more money is spent on toliet paper then math and science classes. I dont know that for a fact but my gut never lies.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them.

By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up.

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toliet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up. I am willing to bet that more money is spent on toliet paper then math and science classes. I dont know that for a fact but my gut never lies. Kids lie though, they cheat, steal and cause trouble with everything they have at their disposal. So why would we give them more things to cause trouble with?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help.
