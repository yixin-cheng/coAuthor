In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online.

The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.

We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage ad",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events.

That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continu",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen.

Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shoul",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such.

 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such.

 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such.

The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen.

That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing.

The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events.

 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world.

 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time.

We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks.

 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen.

We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks.

It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks.

 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best wa",user,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events.

We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks.

It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online.

We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I e",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online.

The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who re",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this art",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this article to spend",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks.

It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this article to spend some time wi",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort.

The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this article to spend some time with their kids today.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this article to spend some time with their kids today.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen.

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this article to spend some time with their kids today.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen.
