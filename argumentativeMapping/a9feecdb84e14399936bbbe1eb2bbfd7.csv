In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid.

Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid.

Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways. 

I think this is less of an issue of if we should pay athletes. We shouldn't. This is more of an issue of if we should set up some sort of system that takes care of the athletes without money being involved. That should be the goal. We still want to allow the athletes to get something in return, it's just that money needs to be taken out of the equation. By doing that we can make everyone happy.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways. 

I think this is less of an issue of if we should pay athletes. We shouldn't. This is more of an issue of if we should set up some sort of system that takes care of the athletes without money being involved. That should be the goal. We still want to allow the athletes to get something in return, it's just that money needs to be taken out of the equation. By doing that we can make everyone happy.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways. 

I think this is less of an issue of if we should pay athletes. We shouldn't. This is more of an issue of if we should set up some sort of system that takes care of the athletes without money being involved. That should be the goal. We still want to allow the athletes to get something in return, it's just that money needs to be taken out of the equation. By doing that we can make everyone happy.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use. 
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways.

It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways. 

I think this is less of an issue of if we should pay athletes. We shouldn't. This is more of an issue of if we should set up some sort of system that takes care of the athletes without money being involved. That should be the goal. We still want to allow the athletes to get something in return, it's just that money needs to be taken out of the equation. By doing that we can make everyone happy. That will end this debate and help to keep the integrity that colleges have in place. That integrity is crucial because if that is gone what is left?",user,16,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
