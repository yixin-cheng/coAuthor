Paying college athletes is an idea whose time has come.
In “College Athletes Should Be Paid,"" David J. Leonard wpoints out that te NCAA and its member institutions have long profited
 from the labor of student athletes and shows that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

So why not let schools pay the athletes, but require the money to be held in trus for them until they either graduate or turn 35, whichever comes first? This eliminates NCAA exploitation while addressing real concerns about whether student athletes will be changed for the worse by their high incomes.

Paying college athletes is an idea whose time has come.
In “College Athletes Should Be Paid,"" David J. Leonard wpoints out that te NCAA and its member institutions have long profited
 from the labor of student athletes and shows that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

This eliminates NCAA exploitation while addressing real concerns about whether student athletes will be changed for the worse by their high incomes.

Paying college athletes is an idea whose time has come.
In “College Athletes Should Be Paid,"" David J. Leonard wpoints out that te NCAA and its member institutions have long profited
 from the labor of student athletes and shows that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

This eliminates NCAA exploitation while addressing real concerns about whether student athletes will be changed for the worse by their high incomes.

 from the labor of student athletes and shows that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

 from the labor of student athletes and shows that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

Paying college athletes is an idea whose time has come.
In “College Athletes Should Be Paid,"" David J. Leonard wpoints out that te NCAA and its member institutions have long profited
 from the labor of student athletes and shows that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

So why not let schools pay the athletes, but require the money to be held in trust for them until they either graduate or turn 35, whichever comes first? This eliminates NCAA exploitation while addressing real concerns about whether student athletes will be changed for the worse by their high incomes.

What about the argument that poorer schools would be forced out of the market? If the schools can't afford to pay the athletes, they shouldn't be in the business of college athletics.

Paying college athletes is an idea whose time has come.
In “College Athletes Should Be Paid,"" David J. Leonard wpoints out that te NCAA and its member institutions have long profited
 from the labor of student athletes and argues that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

So why not let schools pay the athletes, but require the money to be held in trust for them until they either graduate or turn 35, whichever comes first? This eliminates NCAA exploitation while addressing real concerns about whether student athletes will be changed for the worse by their high incomes.

What about the argument that poorer schools would be forced out of the market? If the schools can't afford to pay the athletes, they shouldn't be in the business of college athletics. Schools already compete for the best and brightest, and recruit actively, regardless of their endowment levels. Adding player salaries to the mix would not change this, just introduce a new element to the mix. And placing the money in trust would serve further to level the field.

Schools already compete for the best and brightest, and recruit actively, regardless of their endowment levels. Adding player salaries to the mix would not change this, just introduce a new element to the mix. And placing the money in trust would serve further to level the field.

 from the labor of student athletes and argues that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.
