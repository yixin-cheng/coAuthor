If not, why not? You can't honestly believe that certain races are stronger than others, because that's racist. You can't be racist against white people, you can only be racist against certain races. These stereotypes prevent people from seeing the person for who they really are. If we don't stop using stereotypes as soon as possible, we're going to end up like Matthew Turner.
