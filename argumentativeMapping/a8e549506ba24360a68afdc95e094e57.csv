And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.

And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions.

And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

In the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

In the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.
But the news is not just about voting.

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

In the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

In the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

In the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example).

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

And in the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed to do so. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision-making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

And in the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed to do so. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision-making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.
