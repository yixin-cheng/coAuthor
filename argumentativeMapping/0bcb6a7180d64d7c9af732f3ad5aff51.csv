How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, online dating is a great way to quickly find partners that are more compatible with you then if you were just trying to find someone based on your much smaller social circle. You can find people with very specific interest that you can not find on your own. The sheer number of potential matches on dating sites far out numbers the amount of people you will consider dating in person by several orders of magnitude. Dating apps also have algorithms that help match you with potential partners that are very close to what you are looking for or how compatible you may potentially be with a person. These algorithms are highly effective. People are also looking at you. You will be contacted by potential partners as well. So its not just one way. Then you can get to know one another a bit before the first date if that is what you want to do. Given how many people are in need of dating or relationships or connections, its no surprise that online dating is very popular. It also does not have the stigma around it that it used to.

In my opinion, online dating is a great way to quickly find partners that are more compatible with you then if you were just trying to find someone based on your much smaller social circle. You can find people with very specific interest that you can not find on your own.

You can find people with very specific interest that you can not find on your own.

In my opinion, online dating is a great way to quickly find partners that are more compatible with you then if you were just trying to find someone based on your much smaller social circle. You can find people with very specific interest that you can not find on your own. The sheer number of potential matches on dating sites far out numbers the amount of people you will consider dating in person by several orders of magnitude. Dating apps also have algorithms that help match you with potential partners that are very close to what you are looking for or how compatible you may potentially be with a person. These algorithms are highly effective. People are also looking at you. You will be contacted by potential partners as well. So its not just one way. Then you can get to know one another a bit before the first date if that is what you want to do. Given how many people are in need of dating or relationships or connections, its no surprise that online dating is very popular. It also does not have the stigma around it that it used to. I believe it is now the most efficient and smart way to choose a potential partner. Its much better then luck and that is usually all you have to work with when out in the world looking for love.
