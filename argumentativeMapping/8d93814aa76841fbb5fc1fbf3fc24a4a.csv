Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency.

Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be.

Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be. This is not the schools' fault, it is the fault of the students and their parents.

Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be. This is not the schools' fault, it is the fault of the students and their parents.

Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be. This is not the schools' fault, it is the fault of the students and their parents. Schools can provide tampons or pads in case of emergencies, but they can't fix irresponsibility and lack of basic knowledge, that responsibility lies with these girls' families, ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.
