Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.

I'm also not surprised to hear that a majority of people found it more upsetting to hear about a dog being beaten by a baseball bat compared to a man. How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other. 

I'm also not surprised to hear that a majority of people found it more upsetting to hear about a dog being beaten by a baseball bat compared to a man. How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other. 

I'm also not surprised to hear that a majority of people found it more upsetting to hear about a dog being beaten by a baseball bat compared to a man. How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other. 

I'm also not surprised to hear that a majority of people found it more upsetting to hear about a dog being beaten by a baseball bat compared to a man. How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.

Animal cruelty is absolutely disgusting and someone that participates in it should be in jail for at least 10 years in my opinion. One of the cruelest things that you can do is hurt a defenseless animal. Those people are the lowest form of human. They're despicable.
