In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process.

I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can.

 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution.

There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change. 

It's also good to be able to communicate with you fellow citizens about things they think about and understand. Keeping up with the news can ensure that you will always have something to talk to people about and that can make someone a more friendly and approachable citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change. 

It's also good to be able to communicate with you fellow citizens about things they think about and understand. Keeping up with the news can ensure that you will always have something to talk to people about and that can make someone a more friendly and approachable citizen.

I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change. 

It's also good to be able to communicate with you fellow citizens about things they think about and understand. Keeping up with the news can ensure that you will always have something to talk to people about and that can make someone a more friendly and approachable citizen.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change. 

It's also good to be able to communicate with you fellow citizens about things they think about and understand. Keeping up with the news can ensure that you will always have something to talk to people about and that can make someone a more friendly and approachable citizen.

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate.
