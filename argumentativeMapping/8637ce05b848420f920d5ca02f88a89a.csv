Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option. 
There are many ways to access free pads and tampons.
 There are community resources, food banks, shelters, and churches. There is the local health department. There are also online resources and websites.   There are also organizations that provide free pads and tampons to students. There should be a team of people that are willing to sit down and do some research.

If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option. 
There are many ways to access free pads and tampons.
 There are community resources, food banks, shelters, and churches. There is the local health department. There are also online resources and websites.   There are also organizations that provide free pads and tampons to students. There should be a team of people that are willing to sit down and do some research. They should be willing to do the research and then make a recommendation. I believe we can make great strides in addressing period poverty if we work together. Together, we can reduce period poverty and improve the lives of students. ",user,22,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option. 
There are many ways to access free pads and tampons.
 There are community resources, food banks, shelters, and churches. There is the local health department. There are also online resources and websites.   There are also organizations that provide free pads and tampons to students. There should be a team of people that are willing to sit down and do some research. They should be willing to do the research and then make a recommendation. I believe we can make great strides in addressing period poverty if we work together.

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons. Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.

Some students resort to stealing because they have no other option.
