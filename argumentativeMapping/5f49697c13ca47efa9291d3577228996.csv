The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physicalives. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips. There is no better chance for them to secure their financial future. ",user,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts.

The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips. There is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.  Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips. There is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.  Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

There is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.  Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts.

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier  They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips. There is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.  Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes. There is no better time for them 

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attra They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips. There is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.  Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes. There is no better time for them 

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attractive. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips.   Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.  They arhere is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I believe that the athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. The athletes are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attractive. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips.   Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.  They are legal adulthere is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. They are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. NThey are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attractive. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips.   Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.  They are legal adults, and there is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. They are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. No other career path has as many risksThey are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attractive. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips.   Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.  They are legal adults, and there is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. They are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. No other career path has as many risks in college. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change.  Their risk is unique among college students. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attractive. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips.   Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.  They are legal adults, and there is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.

The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization. We don't need the 60-year-old football coach to get his 6th Lamborghini. We need the young, fit, and talented athletes to get their fair share of the pie.
