What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So",user,14,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor.

The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do.

 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone.

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process.

 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor.

What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support.

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your fam",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with y",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother, believes",user,25,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be mis",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the mo",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the most.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly.

So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the most.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the most.

What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the most.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the most.

But after you've done all that and you're safe, I wish you all",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
