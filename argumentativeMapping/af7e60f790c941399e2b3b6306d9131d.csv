In my opinion, we should keep up with what's going on in the world.   We should always be informed and current on what is happening because if something big happens we should know how it affects us and our community. It is our responsibility as citizens to stay informed.  
Some people might not engage with current events because they don't have time , but that is their choice. I have heard many times, if you're not informed, then you don't have a voice.

At that point, it will be too late to do all the research to help you determine the best action and who to trust.   I personally think we should be aware and follow current events. Some people find the news to be depressing because they always cover death and disaster. But there are many news sources available these days that cover a variety of topics.
