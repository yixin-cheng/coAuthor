In my opinion, we should keep up with what's going on in the world.   We should always be informed and current on what is happening because if something big happens we should know how it affects us and our community. It is our responsibility as citizens to stay informed.  
Some people might not engage with current events because they don't have time , but that is their choice. I have heard many times, if you're not informed, then you don't have a voice.  I think staying informed does matter. In everyday life, it might be overwhelming to try to take on news or any new information. But there might come a time when there's a sudden big change or change in events that directly affects you. If that should happen, you might be faced with tough decisions that have to be made fast. At that point, it will be too late to do all the research to help you determine the best action and who to trust.   I personally think we should be aware and follow current events.

In my opinion, we should keep up with what's going on in the world.   We should always be informed and current on what is happening because if something big happens we should know how it affects us and our community. It is our responsibility as citizens to stay informed.  
Some people might not engage with current events because they don't have time , but that is their choice. I have heard many times, if you're not informed, then you don't have a voice.  I think staying informed does matter. In everyday life, it might be overwhelming to try to take on news or any new information. But there might come a time when there's a sudden big change or change in events that directly affects you. If that should happen, you might be faced with tough decisions that have to be made fast. At that point, it will be too late to do all the research to help you determine the best action and who to trust.   I personally think we should be aware and follow current events. Some people find the news to be depressing because they always cover death and disaster. But there are many news sources available these days that cover a variety of topics.  This includes sports, entertainment, trends and even recipes. It is best to follow your intuition and find some things to check regularly.
