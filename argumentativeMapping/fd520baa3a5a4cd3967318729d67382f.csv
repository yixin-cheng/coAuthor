In my opinion, it is not quite as good as reading an actual book. I think that hearing your own voice in your head as you read words pulls you in more. You also have to focus more on the book if you are physically reading it. When you are listening to an audiobook, you can do other things while you listen. That's both good and bad. It's good for someone who doesn't like to read but wants to expand their world a little. It's also good for someone who is very busy and only has time to listen to an audiobook while they are cleaning the house or driving to and from work. 
I think that listening to an audiobook is a great way to get into the habit of reading.
 It can expose you to genres that you may not have known you liked before. It can also help you to figure out who your favorite author is. You can then choose to go and get physical copies of their books to read. I think that listening to audiobooks is a great way to get into the habit of reading.

There are also people who do not have good eye site or get headaches while reading that benefit from an audiobook. So for those people it's possibly the only choice that would work for them.

In my opinion, it is not quite as good as reading an actual book. I think that hearing your own voice in your head as you read words pulls you in more. You also have to focus more on the book if you are physically reading it. When you are listening to an audiobook, you can do other things while you listen. That's both good and bad. It's good for someone who doesn't like to read but wants to expand their world a little. It's also good for someone who is very busy and only has time to listen to an audiobook while they are cleaning the house or driving to and from work.
