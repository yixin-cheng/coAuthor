Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, it is not quite as good as reading an actual book. I think that hearing your own voice in your head as you read words pulls you in more. You also have to focus more on the book if you are physically reading it. When you are listening to an audiobook, you can do other things while you listen. That's both good and bad. It's good for someone who doesn't like to read but wants to expand their world a little. It's also good for someone who is very busy and only has time to listen to an audiobook while they are cleaning the house or driving to and from work. 
I think that listening to an audiobook is a great way to get into the habit of reading.
 It can expose you to genres that you may not have known you liked before. It can also help you to figure out who your favorite author is. You can then choose to go and get physical copies of their books to read. I think that listening to audiobooks is a great way to get into the habit of reading.

There are also people who do not have good eye site or get headaches while reading that benefit from an audiobook. So for those people it's possibly the only choice that would work for them. 

The selection of audiobooks is great. They are often more readily available to download from Amazon or even the library than some of the physical copies, especially if a book is more rare. It's a great alternative in these cases. 
I think that there are some disadvantages to listening to an audiobook.
 It can make it so you never get into the habit of reading physical book. That's a shame because it's such a great journey to take. You can also miss out on some of the great things that come from reading a physical book. The act of holding it and using a bookmark. It brings back nostalgic memories from a simpler time.
