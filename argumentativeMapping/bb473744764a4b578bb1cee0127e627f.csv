The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, I say totally embrace it for the time being. nd it’s not because I believe that there are no consequences to screen time., but I think our current situation actually calls for increased screen time and we will all benefit from it more then not.  I think it should be this way for two reasons: we need them for work and school and we also need them for socializing and entertainment. Basically, I think the benefits of shifting the dominant communication tool from face-to-face communication to chat or text communication is what will ultimately save lives. I dont think there is any argument there.
