The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

I think it should be this way for two reasons: we need them for work and school and we also need them for socializing and entertainment. Basically, I think the benefits of shifting the dominant communication tool from face-to-face communication to chat or text communication is what will ultimately save lives. I dont think there is any argument there.
