In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world.

In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world.

In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodie and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe.",user,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us.

This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe. It is also important to have a good base of scientific knowledge because our earth's climate is going through drastic changes and competency in this matter will be more and more important as time goes on.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe. It is also important to have a good base of scientific knowledge because our earth's climate is going through drastic changes and competency in this matter will be more and more important as time goes on.

In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe. It is also important to have a good base of scientific knowledge because our earth's climate is going through drastic changes and competency in this matter will be more and more important as time goes on.

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe. It is also important to have a good base of scientific knowledge because our earth's climate is going through drastic changes and competency in this matter will be more and more important as time goes on.
