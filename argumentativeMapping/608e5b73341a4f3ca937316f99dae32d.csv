In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often reports

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public wi

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government re

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act.   ",user,15,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act.

Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.  The news often focuses on problems that may not be a problem for certain individuals--yet.   It is always a good thing to see what issues other people are",user,18,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.  The news often focuses on problems that may not be a problem for certain individuals--yet.   It is always a good thing to see what issues other people are going through.

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.  The news often focuses on problems that may not be a problem for certain individuals--yet.   It is always a good thing to see what issues other people are going through.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.  The news often focuses on problems that may not be a problem for certain individuals--yet.   It is always a good thing to see what issues other people are going through.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.

Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.  The news often focuses on problems that may not be a problem for certain individuals--yet.   It is always a good thing to see what issues other people are going through.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.
