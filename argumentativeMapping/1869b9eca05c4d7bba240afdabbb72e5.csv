Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many and the lack of empathy is a major factor in the perpetuation of human suffering.",user,13,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings. 

Regardless, it is understandable that many would take it to resolve animal suffering versus the suffering of other human beings, given what factors are seen in both that affects how they eso",user,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings. 

Regardless, it is understandable that many would take it to resolve animal suffering versus the suffering of other human beings, given what factors are seen in both that affects how they resolve. Some",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings. 

Regardless, it is understandable that many would take it to resolve animal suffering versus the suffering of other human beings, given what factors are seen in both that affects how they resolve.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare.

There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving.
