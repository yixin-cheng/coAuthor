In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I believe that humans have been on earth far longer than animals and, therefore, have more experience and knowledge of the world in which we live to deal with their suffering. In comparison, animals have not evolved for as long and do not know their way of the world as well as we do. As a consequence, they usually do not know how to actively change their circumstances. For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I believe that humans have been on earth far longer than animals and, therefore, have more experience and knowledge of the world in which we live to deal with their suffering. In comparison, animals have not evolved for as long and do not know their way of the world as well as we do. As a consequence, they usually do not know how to actively change their circumstances. For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves.

For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

174,text-insert,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I believe that humans have been on earth far longer than animals and, therefore, have more experience and knowledge of the world in which we live to deal with their suffering. In comparison, animals have not evolved for as long and do not know their way of the world as well as we do. As a consequence, they usually do not know how to actively change their circumstances. For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves. In addition, animals are usually not able to speak for themselves so it is up to us as human beings to advocate for them; they cannot do it themselves. Then, there is the subject of intelligence. I believe that since animals are not as intelligent as humans (this is my opinion, based on the information I have been taught) , if they suffer, they are not able to take action to stop it because they are limited in their intelligence and cannot think it through to save themselves. We, humans, are able to think through our own suffering and plan our own escape from it. I also believe that, since we are more intelligent, our morals are greater and therefore, we should feel more empathy for animal suffering. Animal suffering is a real problem. To conclude, I think that it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. ",user,16,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
