Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I believe that humans have been on earth far longer than animals and, therefore, have more experience and knowledge of the world in which we live to deal with their suffering. In comparison, animals have not evolved for as long and do not know their way of the world as well as we do. As a consequence, they usually do not know how to actively change their circumstances. For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves. In addition, animals are usually not able to speak for themselves so it is up to us as human beings to advocate for them; they cannot do it themselves. Then, there is the subject of intelligence.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I believe that humans have been on earth far longer than animals and, therefore, have more experience and knowledge of the world in which we live to deal with their suffering. In comparison, animals have not evolved for as long and do not know their way of the world as well as we do. As a consequence, they usually do not know how to actively change their circumstances. For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves.
