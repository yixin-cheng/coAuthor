In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news doe

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that re

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Some

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Sometimes not knowing something allows it to not have a negativ

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Sometimes not knowing something allows it to not have a negative affect on you at all.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Sometimes not knowing something allows it to not have a negative affect on you at all.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Sometimes not knowing something allows it to not have a negative affect on you at all.

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Sometimes not knowing something allows it to not have a negative affect on you at all.

I keep up with the news on social media because if a story is big enough, I'll see it on my timeline. That's the way that I like to see my news, and that's the way it
