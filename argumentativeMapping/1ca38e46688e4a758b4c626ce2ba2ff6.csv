Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel.

There's always the possibility.

We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal.

There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility.

We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel.

Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyo",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate.

Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's t",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal.

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things.

There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die.

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal.

Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves and or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in a barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves an or their family.
