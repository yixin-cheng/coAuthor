On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person.

One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Personally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintances have had very different experiences, and some have even met long term partners, or even spouses, through these means.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Personally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintances have had very different experiences, and some have even met long term partners, or even spouses, through these means.

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Personally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintances have had very different experiences, and some have even met long term partners, or even spouses, through these means.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person.

Personally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintances have had very different experiences, and some have even met long term partners, or even spouses, through these means.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person.

Personally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintances have had very different experiences, and some have even met long term partners, or even spouses, through these means.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person.
