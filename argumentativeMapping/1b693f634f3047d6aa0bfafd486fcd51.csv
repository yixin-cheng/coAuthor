After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All t",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, technology is great for dating, and many other ways to meet people. I think it's easier to meet people online/online dating than the old-fashioned way. Don't believe me? Let me tell you why I hold this opinion. 
For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating.

In my opinion, technology is great for dating, and many other ways to meet people. I think it's easier to meet people online/online dating than the old-fashioned way. Don't believe me? Let me tell you why I hold this opinion. 
For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating.

For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating. 

It really is a great way to meet people. A long time ago also, I met my best friend through technology and a gaming form of social media named world of warcraft. that was ages ago though.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is great for dating, and many other ways to meet people. I think it's easier to meet people online/online dating than the old-fashioned way. Don't believe me? Let me tell you why I hold this opinion. 
For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating. 

It really is a great way to meet people. A long time ago also, I met my best friend through technology and a gaming form of social media named world of warcraft. that was ages ago though.

My whole point is there are great ways to meet people and have relationships using technology. Anyone who says otherwise is jus",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago.

After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology is great for dating, and many other ways to meet people. I think it's easier to meet people online/online dating than the old-fashioned way. Don't believe me? Let me tell you why I hold this opinion. 
For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating. 

It really is a great way to meet people. A long time ago also, I met my best friend through technology and a gaming form of social media named world of warcraft. that was ages ago though.

My whole point is there are great ways to meet people and have relationships using technology. Anyone who says otherwise is just really old fashion and not with the times, or has been really hurt by someone through the use of technology. Esspecial",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology is great for dating, and many other ways to meet people. I think it's easier to meet people online/online dating than the old-fashioned way. Don't believe me? Let me tell you why I hold this opinion. 
For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating.

Anyone who says otherwise is just really old fashion and not with the times, or has been really hurt by someone through the use of technology. Especially dating and social media apps.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology is great for dating, and many other ways to meet people. I think it's easier to meet people online/online dating than the old-fashioned way. Don't believe me? Let me tell you why I hold this opinion. 
For me, the internet is a great way to make friends all over the world.
 I met a woman online, a long time ago, and while it did not work out... it kind of did. I met her on a dating app before traveling abroad awhile ago. When I went abroad, I found out that she was in a relationship, but I still didn't give up hope.  Using the same app on my phone I met another woman. After talking awhile, we met up. After a few trips, and using technology to keep in touch and plan trips we are now married today. She has been here in the US for a few years now, and our marriage is great. She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating.
