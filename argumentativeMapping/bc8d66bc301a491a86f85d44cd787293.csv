In my opinion, one of the most stereo typical characters that made me cringe was Steve Erkel. I think some of the cheap laughs that the writers and producers were going for fell flat and made him into a very annoying character that I literally groaned.

They tried to make it seem like anyone that was a ""nerd"" was socially inept, walking around looking stupid while being smart. The comedy was bad also.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, one of the most stereo typical characters that made me cringe was Steve Erkel. I think some of the cheap laughs that the writers and producers were going for fell flat and made him into a very annoying character that I literally groaned. They tried to portray him as the classic stereo typical nerd. With big glasses always falling off his face, suspenders, pocket protector, lanky, and socially awkward. It bothered me because it was terrible writing, bad comedy, and full on negative stereotypes. They tried to make it seem like anyone that was a ""nerd"" was socially inept, walking around looking stupid while being smart. The comedy was bad also.

Normally I would not mind stereo types in a TV show, as long as it is used in good taste unlike my example I just talked about. The use of stereo typical character types also makes me cringe especially when it is done without any awareness. Shows like the Big Bang Theory does it in taste without taking it to far. What I mean is that there are some shows where it is obvious they are stereotyping someone for the sake of cheap laughs, but no one in the real world is really like that for the most part.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, one of the most stereo typical characters that made me cringe was Steve Erkel. I think some of the cheap laughs that the writers and producers were going for fell flat and made him into a very annoying character that I literally groaned. They tried to portray him as the classic stereo typical nerd. With big glasses always falling off his face, suspenders, pocket protector, lanky, and socially awkward. It bothered me because it was terrible writing, bad comedy, and full on negative stereotypes. They tried to make it seem like anyone that was a ""nerd"" was socially inept, walking around looking stupid while being smart. The comedy was bad also.

Normally I would not mind stereo types in a TV show, as long as it is used in good taste unlike my example I just talked about. The use of stereo typical character types also makes me cringe especially when it is done without any awareness. Shows like the Big Bang Theory does it in taste without taking it to far. What I mean is that there are some shows where it is obvious they are stereotyping someone for the sake of cheap laughs, but no one in the real world is really like that for the most part.
