In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine. 

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. We can look up information we need quickly, it's convenient to look up something on your phone while you are out shopping.

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine. 

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. We can look up information we need quickly, it's convenient to look up something on your phone while you are out shopping. 

Technology is helpful in so many ways there's really no reason why we should be worried about spending too much time on screens besides for our eyes getting strained.

To conclude: Excessive screen time can definitely strain your eyes and cause stress, but I think we'll be fine as long as we take periodic breaks each day and don't spend too much time on our screens.
