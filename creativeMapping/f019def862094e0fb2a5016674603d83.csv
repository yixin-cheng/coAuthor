I'm very hot and very tired and I want to go inside.  I want to be anywhere else but here with this dratted bee.

It's hot.  Sweat trickles all over me including into my eyes.  Still, I remain immobile.  Jeez, it seems like hours I've been standing here.  Why doesn't this bee take off and go find some sweet flower to sip from?  I'm not a flower, I'm a human being!

I can see the bee out of the corner of my eye.  It's sitting there just as pretty as you please as if it has a right to be there.  Fly away, fly away I think to myself, that's why you have wings!  I'm very hot and very tired and I want to go inside.  I want to be anywhere else but here with this dratted bee.  I'm becoming afraid that standing here much longer in the full sun in this heat will make me pass out.  If the bee then stings me I won't be conscious to inject with the Epi Pen.

The Epi Pen will save my life but being stung is a frightful thing for me.  I'm a little boy again, watching my father die from a bee sting.

It's hot.  Sweat trickles all over me including into my eyes.  Still, I remain immobile.  Jeez, it seems like hours I've been standing here.  Why doesn't this bee take off and go find some sweet flower to sip from?  I'm not a flower, I'm a human being!

I can see the bee out of the corner of my eye.  It's sitting there just as pretty as you please as if it has a right to be there.  Fly away, fly away I think to myself, that's why you have wings!  I'm very hot and very tired and I want to go inside.  I want to be anywhere else but here with this dratted bee.  I'm becoming afraid that standing here much longer in the full sun in this heat will make me pass out.  If the bee then stings me I won't be conscious to inject with the Epi Pen.  I look around without moving my head to see who else is around who is in the know about my allergy.  I don't see anyone.
