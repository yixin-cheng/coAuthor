You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK.

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip.

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

At first, you think it's some kind of a joke, possibly pulled by Biden. It's got his style - not funny in any way. So you sigh, and slowly dial the number, wanting to just get it over with. The voice that answers the phone jolts you out of your chair. It's JFK's voice. You know that voice well, after all, he's been your role model since you were a youth.  He says only one word to you. ""Plane.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?""FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" At first, you think it's some kind of a joke, possibly pulled by Biden. It's got his style - not funny in any way. So you sigh, and slowly dial the number, wanting to just get it over with. The voice that answers the phone jolts you out of your chair. It's JFK's voice. You know that voice well, after all, he's been your role model since you were a youth.  He says only one word to you. ""Plane.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""
