At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""yo",user,38,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip. At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden. You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip.

At the ramp leading up to the plane, you are met, not by the pilot, but by a solemn man in a dark suit. He looks familiar, but you can't quite place him. ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" you ask. ""I'm not sure you'd remember. I've had so many jobs, you see.""

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.

You hear a muffled roar of jet engines, and look outside. A stealth bomber has just landed on your small Martha's Vinyard runway, it's nose nearly in your bougainvillea garden.

You ask the voice on the phone for more instructions, but   he has already hung up. You throw a few necessities in your luggage, and head downstairs to the airstrip.

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair. Just as you settle in, a stewardess approaches with a tray of champagne. ""Compliments of the pilot, sir,"" she says. You look curiously up to the cockpit, and see that the pilot is JFK. You move to a closer seat.

""How are you alive? What is this about? What......."" He cuts off your questions. ""I'm not alive."" He says. ""Then I'm..."" He gives you a gentle look.  ""That's right, you're dead.""

You look through the cockpit, as a golden light draws near. ""And we're going to...."" He smiles at you. ""You guessed it.""

You give him a nervous look, and ask one last question, as the light envelops you. ""Trump's not gonna be there, is he?"" FK smiles.
