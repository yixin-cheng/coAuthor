After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell.

The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again.

The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem.

Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again.

Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell.

 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire.

 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem.

text-insert,"Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past.

To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire.

Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again.

She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past.

The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions th",user,44,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that put the U",user,44,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that put the U.S. in a more",user,44,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.

 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.

The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years.

The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. T",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor.

 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years.

 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again.

After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that S",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces.

Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years.

The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious.

 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship.

The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that Soeurette was out and that Tyler was in.

Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that Soeurette was out and that Tyler was in.

 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem.

Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years.

The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world.

The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past.

Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that Soeurette was out and that Tyler was in.

After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that Soeurette was out and that Tyler was in.
