She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. This time, he has shapeshifted into Elon Musk and assumed his identity. He put the real Elon Musk in a small prison in his basement, feeding him ten apples a day and a small. bit of ham. The real Elon Musk is becoming frail. 

One day, fake Elon Musk asks Christina, the woman he has been dating over and over before this, to move in with him. She agrees. Oddly, every time before meals, fake Elon Musk disappears for a few minutes. Christina wonders where he's going off to and follows him one day.  She is careful to be quiet and not get caught.

Fake Elon Musk looks over his shoulder a few times but doesn't spot Christina. He approaches the prison in his basement and slides a tray of apples and ham under the door.

Christina runs silently towards the master bedroom and pretends to be sleeping. Fake Elon Musk doesn't suspect a thing. e pulls the curtains shut and climbs into bed with Christina.

As fake Elon Musk sleeps, Christina wakes up and quietly opens her purse. and takes out her cell phone. She goes down to the secret prison and begins talking to the door. ""Who is in there, do you need help?"" She asks. She hears a faint voice from behind the door. ""What was that, sorry, you'll have to speak up."" She says.
The voice behind the door gets louder and clearer, ""Help me!""


The door is sealed with a coded lock. She thinks she knows the code to get in there. It's probably the birthday of fake Elon Musk's favorite fish. She enters the code and the door opens.
