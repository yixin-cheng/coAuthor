he bees look at each other, then back up at you.
 ""We're sorry it came to this, "" One of the bee says. She flies lightly over and stings you on your hand. 
Your body tenses up and your face turns red.
 Your eyes go wide and your tongue turns black. You fall to the ground, gripping your throat. You hear the bees laughing.  ""You pushed us too far,"" the same bee says. ""And now,, evil tyrant, you'll die."" 
As you lay dying, the bees' laughter slowly fades and the sound of anothingnessrfills your ears.
 Perhaps you were wrong to enslave them and ask them for too much. ",user,39,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
