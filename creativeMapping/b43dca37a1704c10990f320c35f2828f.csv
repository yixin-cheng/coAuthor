You can't feel it and there is no timekeeping mechanism on display, anywhere in the theater. You are just watching your next life, and you are watching it unfold in real time.

It feels so odd to watch day turn to night, and months pass, on screen. You don't feel bored and you have no concept of time passing, in your space. You wonder how all of this is possible? How can you be watching your next life, in real time, and how can you be watching it in a theater, with other people who look just like you? These questions are huge.

The questions begin to form in your mind, you have specific ideas on how to improve things but can't say them in a language that your fellow audience members will understand.
