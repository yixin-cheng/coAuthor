The man in the car gets out and walks towards the child. ""Hi Uncle Mark"" the child yells excited. Uncle Mark? It's none other than The Mark Knopfler. ""You know, I have been thinking about you a lot lately"" Mark says. 

Mark and the child walk into the cottage with a quaint kitchen and stew simmering on the stove. ""Where is your dad?"" Mark asks. ""He is in the other room, playing with his guitar"" the child says.  Mark was intrigued, being that there were no musical notes in the air. ""Hey Chester, guess who?"" Mark shouts. Still, no sound. Mark walks in to find his brother toppled over and perfectly still. Mark checks for a pulse. ""He is dead"" Mark says. The child begins to cry.

The man in care, lo and behold, drives into a clearing with a small cottage on the far side.  A small child appears from the side of the cottage, singing and skipping to Mark Knopfler's guitar. The man in the car gets out and walks towards the child. ""Hi Uncle Mark"" the child yells excited. Uncle Mark? It's none other than The Mark Knopfler. ""You know, I have been thinking about you a lot lately"" Mark says. 

Mark and the child walk into the cottage with a quaint kitchen and stew simmering on the stove. ""Where is your dad?"" Mark asks. ""He is in the other room, playing with his guitar"" the child says.  Mark was intrigued, being that there were no musical notes in the air. ""Hey Chester, guess who?"" Mark shouts. Still, no sound. Mark walks in to find his brother toppled over and perfectly still. Mark checks for a pulse. ""He is dead"" Mark says. The child begins to cry.
