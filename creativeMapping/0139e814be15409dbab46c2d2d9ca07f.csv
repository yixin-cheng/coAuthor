This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth.

But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. H",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.
The aliens are not so thrilled.

They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem.

The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting.

The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona.

They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI.

They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.
The aliens are not so thrilled.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt.

  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona.

The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too.

 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too.

They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem.

  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI.

They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem.

This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt.

Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.
The aliens are not so thrilled.

 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI.

They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.

 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.
The aliens are not so thrilled.
 They will miss the stories and having such a famous and friendly person in their company. Matt hates to see his new friends punished, and he ensures there will be no repercussions for his kidnapping. The aliens ask Matt if there is anything they can do to make him stay.

 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem.

This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.
The aliens are not so thrilled.

But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt. They are quite shocked, and Matt is quite shocked. He had no idea the rescue would happen so quickly. He is loved!! He is so grateful and excited to be going home.
The aliens are not so thrilled.
 They will miss the stories and having such a famous and friendly person in their company. Matt hates to see his new friends punished, and he ensures there will be no repercussions for his kidnapping. The aliens ask Matt if there is anything they can do to make him stay.

 They will miss the stories and having such a famous and friendly person in their company.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. They know he has made some decent movies, mainly they loved Good Will Hunting. But they haven't seen him in anything recently and want to know if he is still a loved actor, or if they can experiment on him. Perhaps cloning?
The aliens are not the only ones who want to know if he is still loved.
 Matt wants to know himself. It seems like ages ago that he was Jason Bourne, and the Ocean's movies are a thing of the past too. Now that his pal, Ben is back with JLO, Matt is feeling very much like an outsider and really needs a boost to his self esteem. Maybe getting taken by aliens isn't such a bad thing for himself, after all.
This is a story of Matt Damon, and his journey to find his place in the world.
  The aliens are kind to him and treat him like a special guest, at least in the beginning. Word soon gets around Earth that Matt is missing, and most of Hollywood, along with the FBI, get involved in looking for him. Someone, I think Will Smith, laughingly suggests he may have been kidnapped by aliens. This causes quite a riot with the tabloids, and Will reinstates his old Men in Black persona. 
Matt is a good sport about it all, and even helps Will Smith with his investigation.
 He sends him secret messages over a burner phone to Will's old MIB phone. Will is completely shocked that he is receiving secret intelligence and he takes his information to the FBI. The FBI actually have an intergalactic task force. Who knew?! They start planning to institute protocol 1AF, which is for finding one actor, and the rescue of Matt Damon is underway.

The aliens have forgotten that they were every planning to experiment on Matt. They are so enthralled with her personality and stories of colleagues, that they forget to pay attention to Earth. They don't know that the FBI is looking for him or that 1AF is underway. Imagine their shock, when a team of Space agents arrive on their planet to reclaim Matt.
