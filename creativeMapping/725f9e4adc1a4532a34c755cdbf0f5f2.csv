I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here anym",user,25,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing.

The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think.

The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think.

 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off.

 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day.

I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back.

I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

I'm not sure if I'm more confused or annoyed.
 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president.

I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off.

I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president.

I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think.

One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here.

He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

The stranger notices the danger. He says, ""I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to help you."" That seems unlikely to me. I tell him I'm not interested in his help. He goes away and never comes back. I",user,43,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think.

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now.

He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

I'm looking around the room to see if someone is standing in the corner giggling. This is a joke, right? It has to be a joke. I'm not amused. 
I'm not sure if I'm more confused or annoyed.
 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now.

Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

The stranger notices the danger. He says, ""I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to help you."" That seems unlikely to me. I tell him I'm not interested in his help. He goes away and never comes back.

 I just go on about my morning, brushing my teeth and getting some Wheaties. I'm not sure what to think. I forget all about it and settle into a movie on Netflix. I love being retired. 
The phone rings.
 I answer it, expecting it to be somebody trying to get me to endorse something. I'm all ready to express that I'm not going to do that when some crazy person on the other end of the line tells me I'm wasting time on a movie, when I should be packing. I hang up and go back to the movie. It's not great, completely unrealistic. They've got a president in this movie that doesn't know the first thing about being a president. I'm not going to sit here and watch this, so I turn it off. 

The phone rings again. By now, I know I've attracted a nut and I'm going to have to do something about it, or the phone will be ringing all day. I pick it up and say, ""Look, I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Don't call here again, please."" That aught to do it, I think. I start getting ready to go on my morning run, since I can't find a decent movie to watch, with a realistic president. 

Now, there's a knock on my door. I open it and there's a man standing there, dressed in a black suit. I yell out for my secret service people to get out of the pool and come in here, right now. One of them shows up, obviously they've started drinking early. He stumbles in and asks what all the noise is about. I tell him some nut is at my door and he needs to get him out of here. He looks around for his sidearm, just in case, but he's left it on his towel out by the pool. This is ridiculous. I tell him to go get it and come back. Then I ask the stranger to sit tight for a minute and we'll get him taken care of.

The stranger notices the danger. He says, ""I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to help you."" That seems unlikely to me. I tell him I'm not interested in his help. He goes away and never comes back. I still can't find anything decent on Netflix. I guess you have to be the president to know what it's",user,44,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
