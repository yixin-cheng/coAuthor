The blockchain is a distributed ledger.

Now you get why you have been told you were allergist. Because nefarious anti-bee forces wants you powerless, kept from taking your place as the Ruler of the Kingdom of Bees.

 You're going to take your rightful place as ruler of the bees. And you're going to do it by ordering your subjects to do what you want.

 You walk over to it and give a command in a whisper. The hive responds, and you hear a buzzing sound. You repeat this process a few times, and instruct your subjects to spread your orders far and wide.
You've also just created a distributed system that is a lot like a blockchain.

The blockchain is a distributed ledger.
 It's a way of storing information that is shared across a network of computers. This ledger is updated by a consensus mechanism, so that everyone on the bee network knows the current state of the ledger.

The next day, a many bees stream out of the air vents in a data center in Belarus. They fly around the datacenter, and land on the servers. When a technician approaches, they stream through his ears and into his brain, where they take command of the person's neural network.
The technician walks over to a rack of servers and gives a command.


Far away, you stare at a computer screen which updates your Bitcoin balance. It goes from zero to five thousand, then ten, then a hundred. You've just made a billion dollars. Or the bees have made it for you, by using their distributed system to made an addendum to the Belarus' servers blockchain with their own Blockchain. The next morning Bitcoins are renamed ""Beecoin"", puzzling techies, who grudgingly accept the change as the probable work of the Winklevoss twins.

Now you get why you have been told you were allergic. Because nefarious anti-bee forces wants you powerless, kept from taking your place as the Ruler of the Kingdom of Bees.
But you're not going to let that happen.
 You're going to take your rightful place as ruler of the bees. And you're going to do it by ordering your subjects to do what you want.
You look around, and see a hive.
 You walk over to it and give a command in a whisper. The hive responds, and you hear a buzzing sound. You repeat this process a few times, and instruct your subjects to spread your orders far and wide.
You've also just created a distributed system that is a lot like a blockchain.

The blockchain is a distributed ledger.
 It's a way of storing information that is shared across a network of computers. This ledger is updated by a consensus mechanism, so that everyone on the bee network knows the current state of the ledger.

The next day, many bees stream out of the air vents in a data center in Belarus. They fly around the datacenter, and land on the servers. When a technician approaches, they stream through his ears and into his brain, where they take command of the person's neural network.

Far away, you stare at a computer screen which updates your Bitcoin balance. It goes from zero to five thousand, then ten, then a hundred. You've just made a billion dollars. Or the bees have made it for you, by using their distributed system to made an addendum to the Belarus' servers blockchain with their own Blockchain. The next morning Bitcoins are renamed ""Beecoin"", puzzling techies, who grudgingly accept the change as the probable work of the Winklevoss twins.

Now you get why you have been told you were allergic. Because nefarious anti-bee forces wants you powerless, kept from taking your place as the Ruler of the Kingdom of Bees.
But you're not going to let that happen.
 You're going to take your rightful place as ruler of the bees. And you're going to do it by ordering your subjects to do what you want.
You look around, and see a hive.
 You walk over to it and give a command in a whisper. The hive responds, and you hear a buzzing sound. You repeat this process a few times, and instruct your subjects to spread your orders far and wide.
You've also just created a distributed system that is a lot like a blockchain.

The blockchain is a distributed ledger.
 It's a way of storing information that is shared across a network of computers. This ledger is updated by a consensus mechanism, so that everyone on the bee network knows the current state of the ledger.

The next day, many bees stream out of the air vents in a data center in Belarus. They fly around the datacenter, and land on the servers. When a technician approaches, they stream through his ears and into his brain, where they take command of the person's neural network.
The technician walks over to a rack of servers and gtypes  command.


Far away, you stare at a computer screen which updates your Bitcoin balance. It goes from zero to five thousand, then ten, then a hundred. Soon you've made a billion dollars. Or the bees have made it for you, by using their distributed system to made an addendum to the Belarus' servers blockchain with their own Blockchain. The next morning Bitcoins are renamed ""Beecoin"", puzzling techies, who grudgingly accept the change as the probable work of the Winklevoss twins.
