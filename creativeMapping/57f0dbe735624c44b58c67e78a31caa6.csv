The blockchain is a distributed ledger.
 It's a way of storing information that is shared across a network of computers. This ledger is updated by a consensus mechanism, so that everyone on the bee network knows the current state of the ledger.

The next day, a many bees stream out of the air vents in a data center in Belarus. They fly around the datacenter, and land on the servers. When a technician approaches, they stream through his ears and into his brain, where they take command of the person's neural network.
The technician walks over to a rack of servers and gives a command.


Far away, you stare at a computer screen which updates your Bitcoin balance. It goes from zero to five thousand, then ten, then a hundred. You've just made a billion dollars. Or the bees have made it for you, by using their distributed system to made an addendum to the Belarus' servers blockchain with their own Blockchain. The next morning Bitcoins are renamed ""Beecoin"", puzzling techies, who grudgingly accept the change as the probable work of the Winklevoss twins.

Far away, you stare at a computer screen which updates your Bitcoin balance. It goes from zero to five thousand, then ten, then a hundred. You've just made a billion dollars.
