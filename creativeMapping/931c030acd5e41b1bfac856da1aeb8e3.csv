""New Earth?"" you ask. ""What's that?"" 
""It's a planet,"" JFK says. ""A planet we're going to terraform and colonize. You're going to help me lead it. It's going to be a big job, and I'm going to need your help. There are those would would kill anyone, to be able to access the ore and minerals there. I'm going to need you to help me run the planet, and keep it safe."" 

You have so many questions. ""Wait, so you didn't die?"" you ask. ""You faked your death?"" 
""I did,"" JFK confirms. ""I faked my death to safely escape, and I've been working on New Earth for the last 80 years. I've been working on it with the help of the best and brightest minds of our time. We have discovered a way to loop time."" ""Loop time?"" you ask.

You have so many questions. ""Wait, so you didn't die?"" you ask. ""You faked your death?"" 
""I did,"" JFK confirms. ""I faked my death to safely escape, and I've been working on New Earth for the last 80 years. I've been working on it with the help of the best and brightest minds of our time. We have discovered a way to loop time."" ""Loop time?"" you ask.

You pick up the paper and idly play with it, while you thing about the meaning. ""Is it...the real JFK?""  you wonder. ""Is it a prank?"" 
You've seen aliens, the Ark of the Covenant, and more strange things in your life, so this could be true. ou decide to call the number.
 
You pick up the phone and dial the number.
 It rings once, and then a voice comes on the line. It's JFK. Or at least someone who sounds like him. You immediately recognize the tone. ""Barry!"" he says. ""Ready to start?"" 
Ready to start what?"" you ask.
 ""What do you mean?"" ""The job I offered you,"" JFK replies.
 ""The job you accepted by calling this number. You're going to need a few things. I'll send them over in the morning."" ""Wait, what job?"" you ask.
 ""What are you talking about?"" 
""The job I offered you,"" JFK repeats. You're going to work with me to help me lead and organize New Earth.""   
""New Earth?"" you ask. ""What's that?"" 
""It's a planet,"" JFK says. ""A planet we're going to terraform and colonize. You're going to help me lead it. It's going to be a big job, and I'm going to need your help. There are those would would kill anyone, to be able to access the ore and minerals there. I'm going to need you to help me run the planet, and keep it safe."" 

You have so many questions. ""Wait, so you didn't die?"" you ask. ""You faked your death?"" 
""I did,"" JFK confirms. ""I faked my death to safely escape, and I've been working on New Earth for the last 80 years. I've been working on it with the help of the best and brightest minds of our time. We have discovered a way to loop time."" ""Loop time?"" you ask.
 ""And what about Jackie? Does she know?"" ""She knows,"" JFK says.
