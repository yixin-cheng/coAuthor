 He already had his bag packed, just in case. He went and fetched his packed bag from the closet, where it had sat for the last 6 years. He grabbed his phone and dialed the number on the note.

Obama did exactly as he was instructed, and entered no code and said nothing while the phone waited for his response. After a few seconds, the automated voice came back on the line. ""Please re-enter your code."" Obama did not respond, and the phone hung up on him. He waited for a few moments, and then the phone rang. ""Yes,"" he said in a low voice. ""I'm here."" said a voice on the line. ""Back door."" Obama hung up the phone and walked to the back door of his house. There he could see JFK standing under the porch light in a trench coat, looking intense. He opened the door and let JFK in. ""Let's go."" said JFK. Obama grabbed his bag, and as instructed, threw his phone into the garbage with the browser open, allowing it to drain the battery faster.   ""What's going on?"" ""Not now. Let's just move."" Obama and JFK walked out of the house and got into JFK's car. JFK started the car and drove off. JFK finally started to look a little relaxed. ""So, you ready for this?"" Obama just waited for an explanation. ""I know you've been waiting for this day for a long time. There's going to be a new white house.

Obama knew this day would come. He knew he would be called back into action. JFK had been preparing him for this day for years. He knew that Obama would be the one to save the world. It all begins with the note. 
The note is the first step in a long journey.
 He already had his bag packed, just in case. He went and fetched his packed bag from the closet, where it had sat for the last 6 years. He grabbed his phone and dialed the number on the note. It rang 3 times, and then was answered by an automated service. ""Please enter your code."" Obama did exactly as he was instructed, and entered no code and said nothing while the phone waited for his response. After a few seconds, the automated voice came back on the line. ""Please re-enter your code."" Obama did not respond, and the phone hung up on him. He waited for a few moments, and then the phone rang. ""Yes,"" he said in a low voice. ""I'm here."" said a voice on the line. ""Back door."" Obama hung up the phone and walked to the back door of his house. There he could see JFK standing under the porch light in a trench coat, looking intense. He opened the door and let JFK in. ""Let's go."" said JFK. Obama grabbed his bag, and as instructed, threw his phone into the garbage with the browser open, allowing it to drain the battery faster.   ""What's going on?"" ""Not now. Let's just move."" Obama and JFK walked out of the house and got into JFK's car. JFK started the car and drove off. JFK finally started to look a little relaxed. ""So, you ready for this?"" Obama just waited for an explanation. ""I know you've been waiting for this day for a long time. There's going to be a new white house. We need you to oversee operations there.""

Obama did exactly as he was instructed, and entered no code and said nothing while the phone waited for his response. After a few seconds, the automated voice came back on the line.

Obama just waited for an explanation. ""I know you've been waiting for this day for a long time. There's going to be a new white house. We need you to oversee operations there."" ""What about the old white house?"" JFK paused for a moment, and then replied, ""We're going to need to blow that up."" Obama was shocked. ""Why?!"" ""Because it's a trap.

Obama knew this day would come. He knew he would be called back into action. JFK had been preparing him for this day for years. He knew that Obama would be the one to save the world. It all begins with the note. 
The note is the first step in a long journey.
 He already had his bag packed, just in case. He went and fetched his packed bag from the closet, where it had sat for the last 6 years. He grabbed his phone and dialed the number on the note. It rang 3 times, and then was answered by an automated service. ""Please enter your code."" Obama did exactly as he was instructed, and entered no code and said nothing while the phone waited for his response. After a few seconds, the automated voice came back on the line. ""Please re-enter your code."" Obama did not respond, and the phone hung up on him. He waited for a few moments, and then the phone rang. ""Yes,"" he said in a low voice. ""I'm here."" said a voice on the line. ""Back door."" Obama hung up the phone and walked to the back door of his house. There he could see JFK standing under the porch light in a trench coat, looking intense. He opened the door and let JFK in. ""Let's go."" said JFK. Obama grabbed his bag, and as instructed, threw his phone into the garbage with the browser open, allowing it to drain the battery faster.   ""What's going on?"" ""Not now. Let's just move."" Obama and JFK walked out of the house and got into JFK's car. JFK started the car and drove off. JFK finally started to look a little relaxed. ""So, you ready for this?"" Obama just waited for an explanation. ""I know you've been waiting for this day for a long time. There's going to be a new white house. We need you to oversee operations there."" ""What about the old white house?"" JFK paused for a moment, and then replied, ""We're going to need to blow that up."" Obama was shocked. ""Why?!"" ""Because it's a trap. Are you on board?""
