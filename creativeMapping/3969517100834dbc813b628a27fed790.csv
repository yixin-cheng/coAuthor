They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.

You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.

They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth.

You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth.

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl.

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again.

They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.
The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

It was a long drawn out battle, with great feats. near losses, last minute triumph. And at the end, you stood triumphant in front of your father, who was still trapped by the queen's spell.

""Finally,"" you said ""What took you so long?""
""This is the first time I've been able to get close enough.""
 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.
The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

It was a long drawn out battle, with great feats. near losses, last minute triumph. And at the end, you stood triumphant in front of your father, who was still trapped by the queen's spell.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.
The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.
The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

 True your family was extremely overprotective, especially when it came to bees. But you knew the truth. They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.
The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

They couldn't stand you and didn't want you around since your brother was more then happy to take over once he came of age. You're not even sure why they kept you around, though having found the secret diary left by your father you had an idea. 

He talked of how you were the true prince and his heir, but he had been ordered to leave you behind and he would never see you again. And how his true identity was King of Bees, but a witch had enchanted him and made him look like a human as punishment. But then he fell in love with a human girl. You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story. It turned out there were two factions of bees, one loyal to your father and one to the queen. The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

But today was different. They had gotten word that the queen would be away and you would be alone.Today, they had finally stolen the queen's spell book.Today was the day you became the bee king, and free you father from the spell.
The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

It was a long drawn out battle, with great feats. near losses, last minute triumph. And at the end, you stood triumphant in front of your father, who was still trapped by the queen's spell. You spoke the words to break the spell, and saw recognition and joy in his eyes. hovered in front of you, and with a cry proclaimed ""All Hail the true Bee King!""
