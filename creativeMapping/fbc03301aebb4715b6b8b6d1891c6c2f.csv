The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude, there's no way I'll be able to blow this house down. I'll have to come up with another plan.""

he wolf fpurchasedoa bundle f dynamite and he brought it back to the house.

The 92nd little piggy came outside of his house and said to the wolf, ""I don't know what you're trying to do, but you're not going to blow my house down. I'm a smart piggy and I've made it out on my own and I have built the strongest house there is. You're not going to blow it down.""
