You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""

He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man.

 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were.

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""

 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man.

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't w",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't worry Barack, your going to",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake.

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were.

""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man.

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't worry Barack, your going to undergo some changes.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man.

 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't worry Barack, your going to undergo some changes.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

No, not you, but a strange looking alien, with a strange looking face, that suddenly morphed back into your own. And that was the last time you saw the Earth, in this form at least.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.
