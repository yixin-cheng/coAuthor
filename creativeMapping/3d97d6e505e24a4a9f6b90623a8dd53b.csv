 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

But that was impossible. Someone must be trying to trick him, but why use such and obviously false name then?
He picked up the phone and dialed the number.
 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping. And you suddenly felt very sleepy. As you lost consciousness, you wondered if you hadn't made a huge mistake. 
You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were. Former Presidents Bush and Clinton were a surprise, but not shocking. But JFK, the real JFK, much older, but quite alive; that was shocking.
""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared.

Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were.

""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""

 Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

You wake up in the back of a limo, and you're not alone.
 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were.

""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't worry Barack, your going to undergo some change",user,45,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't worry Barack, your going to undergo some changes. A",user,46,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man.

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here. We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.""
""But, but, I don't understand.
"" You look to JFK. Bluntly ""You're dead.""

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""

You started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. 

""THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!"" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run. But the Secret Service agents had already grabbed you. And as they marched you towards the ship you heard someone call out ""Don't worry Barack, your going to undergo some changes.

 But none of the people with you were your agents. But you recognize them. All of them. And they're all smiling at you. But this was impossible, or at least some of them were.

""Welcome to the club, Barack.""
 

You haven't stammered since asking out your first girlfriend back in high school. But all you could get out was ""Wa wa, Wait. Club, what club, ? This isn't, I don't, What...?""

Everyone, even the driver, chuckled a bit. ""Barack, you're a smart man. Do you really think the accumulated experience and potential of US Presidents is just left to fade away after our terms are done. No, now you really get to do some work. But, not here.

""But, but, I don't understand.

He looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. ""Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.""
