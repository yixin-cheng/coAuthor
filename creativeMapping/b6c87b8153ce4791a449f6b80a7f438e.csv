The alien has been looking for a new pet, an human, ad he's found it in the form of Matt Damon.
  Really, any human would have done but he just ran across Matt Damon first surrounded by a crowd of other humans.  
The alien takes Matt Damon to his ship and prepares to take him home.
  Suddenly, his ship is buzzed by US fighter aircraft.  The alien is confused.  The puny jets are all around.  What is this?"" the alien asks.
  A voice comes in over his comm system. ""This is the United States Air Force.  You have our revered citizen Matt Damon and we demand his immediate release.""  The alien is shocked.  Hmmm, he muses I thought I had a human but this is a 'citizen, a Matt Damon'.  This won't do.  

The alien takes a confused and befuddled Matt Damon and transports him back to the surface of the Earth.  He moves the ship to a less stressful place, one without the jets buzzing about and spys what he believes to be a human surrounded by beasts of another sort.  He double-checks his system's ID of a human and it verifies this is one.  He takes him and brings him to the ship.  He holds his breath waiting to see if anyone or anything appears to challenge him about taking something that isn't a human.  After a period of time, he heaves a sigh of relief.
