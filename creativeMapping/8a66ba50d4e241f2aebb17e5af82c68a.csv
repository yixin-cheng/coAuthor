She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He has learned what she likes and what she hates. It's like the movie Groundhog day basically where he just gets many chances to get it perfect. 

This time around he's been dating her for a few months. He decides it is time to propose. He's never gotten that far before. She agrees to marry him. He is utterly shocked. It finally worked!

She begins planning the wedding. He gets very anxious that something will go wrong. He is absolutely certain that something will, and it always has. Finally the wedding day rolls around. The wedding goes off without any issues and it's finally the wedding night. 

She decides to tell him that she knows he is a shapeshifter. He is shocked. This is the first time she has figured it out, and he's worried that this will be the end of their relationship. She says that she found out recently, having seen him do it one day when he thought she wasn't around. 
She says that she doesn't mind.
 It will keep things from getting boring as she can sleep with any celebrity that she wants with his power. He feels a little hurt. He hadn't expected her to want to use him in such a way. Maybe he didn't really know her as well as he had thought. 

He tells her he doesn't know if he is comfortable with that. Maybe they should rethink their marriage. She becomes enraged. He gets up to leave and she knocks him out. 

He wakes up , chained in their new home. 

She stands over him, looking down.

He has learned what she likes and what she hates. It's like the movie Groundhog day basically where he just gets many chances to get it perfect. 

This time around he's been dating her for a few months. He decides it is time to propose. He's never gotten that far before. She agrees to marry him. He is utterly shocked. It finally worked!

She begins planning the wedding. He gets very anxious that something will go wrong. He is absolutely certain that something will, and it always has. Finally the wedding day rolls around. The wedding goes off without any issues and it's finally the wedding night. 

She decides to tell him that she knows he is a shapeshifter. He is shocked. This is the first time she has figured it out, and he's worried that this will be the end of their relationship. She says that she found out recently, having seen him do it one day when he thought she wasn't around. 
She says that she doesn't mind.
 It will keep things from getting boring as she can sleep with any celebrity that she wants with his power. He feels a little hurt. He hadn't expected her to want to use him in such a way. Maybe he didn't really know her as well as he had thought. 

He tells her he doesn't know if he is comfortable with that. Maybe they should rethink their marriage. She becomes enraged. He gets up to leave and she knocks him out. 

He wakes up , chained in their new home.

text-delete,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He has learned what she likes and what she hates. It's like the movie Groundhog day basically where he just gets many chances to get it perfect. 

This time around he's been dating her for a few months. He decides it is time to propose. He's never gotten that far before. She agrees to marry him. He is utterly shocked. It finally worked!

She begins planning the wedding. He gets very anxious that something will go wrong. He is absolutely certain that something will, and it always has. Finally the wedding day rolls around. The wedding goes off without any issues and it's finally the wedding night. 

She decides to tell him that she knows he is a shapeshifter. He is shocked. This is the first time she has figured it out, and he's worried that this will be the end of their relationship. She says that she found out recently, having seen him do it one day when he thought she wasn't around. 
She says that she doesn't mind.
 It will keep things from getting boring as she can sleep with any celebrity that she wants with his power. He feels a little hurt. He hadn't expected her to want to use him in such a way. Maybe he didn't really know her as well as he had thought. 

He tells her he doesn't know if he is comfortable with that. Maybe they should rethink their marriage. She becomes enraged. He gets up to leave and she knocks him out. 

He wakes up , chained in their new home. 

She stands over him, looking down. 

""You wanted this all along, didn't you? Now you have me."" she says. 

""Change into something attractive for me by the time I get ba. You know what I like, honey."" she says. 

She sits a tray of food down for him and leaves the room. ",user,34,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
