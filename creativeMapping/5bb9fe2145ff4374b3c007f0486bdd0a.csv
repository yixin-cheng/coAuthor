She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, s",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love.

If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she didn't mind at all.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her.

text-delete,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot!

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

He answered every question with honesty and openness, melting the woman's heart. She knew that it might be tough",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot!

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot!

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love.

He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

He answered every question with honesty and openness, melting the woman's heart. She knew then that she wanted to pursue",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region.

If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

He answered every question with honesty and openness, melting the woman's heart. She knew then that she wanted to pursue a relationship with him, but they had to take it slow. They",user,29,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love.

One day, the shapeshifter said something that sounded very familiar to her. It was almost word for word what her last boyfriend said. She was about to ask him if he had been in a relationship before, but he disappeared right in front of her. 

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot!

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

He answered every question with honesty and openness, melting the woman's heart. She knew then that she wanted to pursue a relationship with him, but they had to take it slow. The shape",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot! She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.

He answered every question with honesty and openness, melting the woman's heart. She knew then that she wanted to pursue a relationship with him, but they had to take it slow. The shapeshifter realize",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A few minutes later, the shapeshifter appeared in front of her. He felt self-conscious about the woman knowing of his obsession with her. Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot!

Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends.

Fortunately for him, she seemed open to the possibility of them becoming more serious with each other. But they had to start off on the right foot!

Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends.

They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

She asked him what his life was like and why he went about things the way he did.
