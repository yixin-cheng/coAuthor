The world is a dangerous place, but it is also filled with wonder.
 This power has been unknown for so long, people really don't know what to do with it. Some have fear that the Earth will end up like Ragnarok when Hella came back, but there are a quiet few who know better. This small group have been studying Mana for generations, passing the secrets of the ancient powers down through their family. Before the world went to pot,  the Keepers of Mana were able to skype and communicate via messenger and social media. They learned the magic spells and ways and kept written journals of what they discovered. This small group knew the time was coming when this power would be needed, and the had to be sure they were ready.

ow, they are ready to share the secrets of the Keepers of Mana with the world.
 There are so few people left, it won't be difficult to pass along what they know. Incredibly enough, each area where humanity survived a Keeper, or more, survived as well.  The Keepers had learned so much in their studies, they are able to communicate with each other via telepathy. They do so, and share what they are teaching to others. The time is coming when the Earth will be ready to battle the aliens that have taken over their loved home. To these few people, this is all too much like a scene from Avengers, and the aliens are no more than a Thanos that needs to be reckoned with.
TWhen the time is ready to do battle, it will be silently fought and the invaders won't know what is coming. Mana is magic that isn't showy or ostentatious. It is subtle and the Keepers and their students will strike without warning. The power comes from being of one mind and fighting for one cause. Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. They will win this war.

Some have fear that the Earth will end up like Ragnarok when Hella came back, but there are a quiet few who know better. This small group have been studying Mana for generations, passing the secrets of the ancient powers down through their family. Before the world went to pot,  the Keepers of Mana were able to skype and communicate via messenger and social media. They learned the magic spells and ways and kept written journals of what they discovered. This small group knew the time was coming when this power would be needed, and the had to be sure they were ready.

The Keepers had learned so much in their studies, they are able to communicate with each other via telepathy. They do so, and share what they are teaching to others. The time is coming when the Earth will be ready to battle the aliens that have taken over their loved home. To these few people, this is all too much like a scene from Avengers, and the aliens are no more than a Thanos that needs to be reckoned with.
TWhen the time is ready to do battle, it will be silently fought and the invaders won't know what is coming. Mana is magic that isn't showy or ostentatious. It is subtle and the Keepers and their students will strike without warning. The power comes from being of one mind and fighting for one cause. Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. They will win this war. 

The day finally arrives when everyone on Earth has been taught the basic principals of the old magic. When all people are ready to be better and do better with the new world they are about to obtain.

The world is a dangerous place, but it is also filled with wonder.
 This power has been unknown for so long, people really don't know what to do with it. Some have fear that the Earth will end up like Ragnarok when Hella came back, but there are a quiet few who know better. This small group have been studying Mana for generations, passing the secrets of the ancient powers down through their family. Before the world went to pot,  the Keepers of Mana were able to skype and communicate via messenger and social media. They learned the magic spells and ways and kept written journals of what they discovered. This small group knew the time was coming when this power would be needed, and the had to be sure they were ready.

ow, they are ready to share the secrets of the Keepers of Mana with the world.
 There are so few people left, it won't be difficult to pass along what they know. Incredibly enough, each area where humanity survived a Keeper, or more, survived as well.  The Keepers had learned so much in their studies, they are able to communicate with each other via telepathy. They do so, and share what they are teaching to others. The time is coming when the Earth will be ready to battle the aliens that have taken over their loved home. To these few people, this is all too much like a scene from Avengers, and the aliens are no more than a Thanos that needs to be reckoned with.
TWhen the time is ready to do battle, it will be silently fought and the invaders won't know what is coming. Mana is magic that isn't showy or ostentatious. It is subtle and the Keepers and their students will strike without warning. The power comes from being of one mind and fighting for one cause. Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. They will win this war. 

The day finally arrives when everyone on Earth has been taught the basic principals of the old magic. When all people are ready to be better and do better with the new world they are about to obtain. They collectively think of what they hope to achieve and how they hope to be when the aliens are gone. Then Mana takes over, and their lives being anew. And wonderful.
