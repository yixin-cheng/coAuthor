You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel.

You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of subslke a photograph, and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse anlke a photograph, and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

You do likewise, and before long you are as immersed in the film as he is. You're watching your own life, and it's kind of boring. You look at him again, and you wonder what he finds so interesting about it.

You shift uneasily in your seat. You find yourself unable to concentrate on the film, because you are unable to fathom what he is so engrossed in. It's just your life, you've seen this before. You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depressione a photograph, and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost.

You attempt to ask the 'you' sitting next to you what's going on, but he shushes you and stares at the film in rapt attention. You do likewise, and before long you are as immersed in the film as he is. You're watching your own life, and it's kind of boring. You look at him again, and you wonder what he finds so interesting about it.

You shift uneasily in your seat. You find yourself unable to concentrate on the film, because you are unable to fathom what he is so engrossed in. It's just your life, you've seen this before. You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy.

You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace.

You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace.

You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.


You watch with horror as you see her, suicidal and depressed, mount a bridge, and stand on the verge of it, ready to end her life by plunging into the icy water below.

She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood.

You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.


You watch with horror as you see her, suicidal and depressed, mount a bridge, and stand on the verge of it, ready to end her life by plunging into the icy water below. You try to reach out to her, but can't, when suddenly a jolt of inspiration strikes you. You tear your eyes away from the screen, and look back to the main screen, where you see yourself standing on a bridge. 

You rush towards the screen, and leap in, and find yourself standing next to her, and you reach out to hold her, and stop her from the fateful plunge. She looks surprised, but not displeased. 'Who are you? I feel like I know you.'

You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost.

You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.

You tear your eyes away from the screen, and look back to the main screen, where you see yourself standing on a bridge. 

You rush towards the screen, and leap in, and find yourself standing next to her, and you reach out to hold her, and stop her from the fateful plunge. She looks surprised, but not displeased. 'Who are you? I feel like I know you.'

You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.


You watch with horror as you see her, suicidal and depressed, mount a bridge, and stand on the verge of it, ready to end her life by plunging into the icy water below. You try to reach out to her, but can't, when suddenly a jolt of inspiration strikes you. You tear your eyes away from the screen, and look back to the main screen, where you see yourself standing on a bridge. 

You rush towards the screen, and leap in, and find yourself standing next to her, and you reach out to hold her, and stop her from the fateful plunge. She looks surprised, but not displeased. 'Who are you? I feel like I know you.'

You shift uneasily in your seat. You find yourself unable to concentrate on the film, because you are unable to fathom what he is so engrossed in. It's just your life, you've seen this before. You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy.

You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.


You watch with horror as you see her, suicidal and depressed, mount a bridge, and stand on the verge of it, ready to end her life by plunging into the icy water below.

You tear your eyes away from the screen, and look back to the main screen, where you see yourself standing on a bridge. 

You rush towards the screen, and leap in, and find yourself standing next to her, and you reach out to hold her, and stop her from the fateful plunge. She looks surprised, but not displeased. 'Who are you? I feel like I know you.'

text-insert,"When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. You attempt to ask the 'you' sitting next to you what's going on, but he shushes you and stares at the film in rapt attention. You do likewise, and before long you are as immersed in the film as he is. You're watching your own life, and it's kind of boring. You look at him again, and you wonder what he finds so interesting about it.

You shift uneasily in your seat. You find yourself unable to concentrate on the film, because you are unable to fathom what he is so engrossed in. It's just your life, you've seen this before. You look around, and spot another film playing in the corner, on a smaller screen. You walk through the aisles, ignoring the complaints of the theatre-goers, and sit in front of that one instead. This screen, is showing a movie about someone else's life, and you are suddenly very interested. She's a young woman, and you watch as she's born, and as she takes her first steps, and goes through infancy, and then childhood. You watch her in school, as she makes friends, and learns to read, and write.

You watch her graduation from high school, a lovely young woman, and you find yourself rooting for her when she applies to college. She gets accepted into a prestigious university, and it makes your heart swell with joy. You see her meet her first love in her sophomore year, and you can't help but feel a little envious of the boy.  You see that he's not treating her the way she deserves,  he's cruel, and unfaithful and you almost wish you could step into the screen and slap him for being so cruel. You find yourself raising your hand, but you restrain yourself.

You sit and watch their inevitable breakup, and your heart breaks for her, and you wish you could help as you see her, heartbroken and lost. You watch with dread as her grades suffer, and she lets herself go physically, and you are on the verge of crying a warning when you see her turning to drugs for solace. You sit helpless as her life eoes into downward spirai of substance abuse and depression and you can't bear to watch her plunge deeper into the abyss.


You watch with horror as you see her, suicidal and depressed, mount a bridge, and stand on the verge of it, ready to end her life by plunging into the icy water below. You try to reach out to her, but can't, when suddenly a jolt of inspiration strikes you. You tear your eyes away from the screen, and look back to the main screen, where you see yourself standing on a bridge. 

You rush towards the screen, and leap in, and find yourself standing next to her, and you reach out to hold her, and stop her from the fateful plunge. She looks surprised, but not displeased. 'Who are you? I feel like I know you.'
