Shortly after she died she went inside to the room where all of us are and the next movie played. Then the date of the hiking trip happened. And right on queue, this time, this version of me died after getting attacked by a bear. It got apparent that all of us in the room died on the same hiking trip. Versions after versions of us appeared and they all died on the same hiking trip. She would get attacked by a bear, a cougar, a wolf, and so on. We would watch a version of us who did not even make it to the hiking trip but died on her bus over to the location.

We had almost the same life with ever so slightly changes from my decisions and some things happening earlier than before, but nothing too different. I died having a boulder fall on me on a hiking trip, but this version of me also went to that hiking trip but she died of a heart attack instead of the boulder.

Shortly after she died she went inside to the room where all of us are and the next movie played. Then the date of the hiking trip happened. And right on queue, this time, this version of me died after getting attacked by a bear. It got apparent that all of us in the room died on the same hiking trip. Versions after versions of us appeared and they all died on the same hiking trip. She would get attacked by a bear, a cougar, a wolf, and so on. We would watch a version of us who did not even make it to the hiking trip but died on her bus over to the location.

It was all the same thing, me thinking that it was my destiny to die that day. Watching myself die one after another, it became very clear to me. The universe wanted me dead that day. I couldn't find any other version of me that survived that day, and I couldn't figure out why.

Until we watched probably the 345th version of us, which the one I am still watching right now. She finally have done it. She saw the boulder far away and she was able to escape from it. She disturbed an animal that bit her on the leg, which caused them to have to go back.

Versions after versions of us appeared and they all died on the same hiking trip. She would get attacked by a bear, a cougar, a wolf, and so on. We would watch a version of us who did not even make it to the hiking trip but died on her bus over to the location.

It was all the same thing, me thinking that it was my destiny to die that day. Watching myself die one after another, it became very clear to me. The universe wanted me dead that day. I couldn't find any other version of me that survived that day, and I couldn't figure out why.

Until we watched probably the 345th version of us, which the one I am still watching right now. She finally have done it. She saw the boulder far away and she was able to escape from it. She disturbed an animal that bit her on the leg, which caused them to have to go back.

A nurse treated her wounds and she was fine. However, the nurse died a few weeks later, as well as other people she knew, and a relative that she didn't even know was dying. 

Three months later the whole world is on lockdown.",user,25,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
