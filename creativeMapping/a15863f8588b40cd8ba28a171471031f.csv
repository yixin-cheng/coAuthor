It turns out that people, over the years, have experienced sharper than normal degradation to their mental processes. People who have been taking the drug continue to look young, but they degrade mentally and emotionally. It gets really pronounced after about 50 years. 
You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you.

You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you.

 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you.

You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you.

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok.

She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you.

You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it.

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending."" Yo",user,40,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

It turns out that people, over the years, have experienced sharper than normal degradation to their mental processes. People who have been taking the drug continue to look young, but they degrade mentally and emotionally. It gets really pronounced after about 50 years. 
You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok.

You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

It turns out that people, over the years, have experienced sharper than normal degradation to their mental processes. People who have been taking the drug continue to look young, but they degrade mentally and emotionally. It gets really pronounced after about 50 years. 
You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending."" You never find out about it because of your demise, but the world really does end. Peopl",user,41,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending."" You never find out about it because of your demise, but the world really does end.

It turns out that people, over the years, have experienced sharper than normal degradation to their mental processes. People who have been taking the drug continue to look young, but they degrade mentally and emotionally. It gets really pronounced after about 50 years. 
You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok.

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it.

 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending."" You never find out about it because of your demise, but the world really does end.

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

2302,text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

It turns out that people, over the years, have experienced sharper than normal degradation to their mental processes. People who have been taking the drug continue to look young, but they degrade mentally and emotionally. It gets really pronounced after about 50 years. 
You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""
