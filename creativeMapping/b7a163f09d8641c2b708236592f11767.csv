My family, my friends, my teachers, my neighbors, and even the people I didn't know. They all loved me, and I loved them. My best friend did not like that.

Some had great endings, some where I grew old and died of old age, some I died of cancer, some I died of a car crash, and some I died of a heart attack. But I couldn't ignore the fact that most of my deaths was done by one person: my best friend. How I died differed each time, but he was always the culprit.

Then I realized why he was doing it. He was jealous of me, he wanted to be the one that was loved by everyone. Right when I was saying goodbye in my death bed, I knew everybody. My family, my friends, my teachers, my neighbors, and even the people I didn't know. They all loved me, and I loved them. My best friend did not like that.

So in all my other lives from these different dimensions I have watched, I have seen the same thing. I wish I could tell my best friend that I love him, and that I forgive him. I wished that I could tell him that I know he is jealous of me, and that I wish he could be happy.

But I couldn't ignore the fact that most of my deaths was done by one person: my best friend. How I died differed each time, but he was always the culprit.

Then I realized why he was doing it. He was jealous of me, he wanted to be the one that was loved by everyone. Right when I was saying goodbye in my death bed, I knew everybody. My family, my friends, my teachers, my neighbors, and even the people I didn't know. They all loved me, and I loved them. My best friend did not like that.

So in all my other lives from these different dimensions I have watched, I have seen the same thing. I wish I could tell my best friend that I love him, and that I forgive him. I wished that I could tell him that I know he is jealous of me, and that I wish he could be happy.

Then I realized why he was doing it. He was jealous of me, he wanted to be the one that was loved by everyone. Right when I was saying goodbye in my death bed, I knew everybody. My family, my friends, my teachers, my neighbors, and even the people I didn't know. They all loved me, and I loved them. My best friend did not like that.

So in all my other lives from these different dimensions I have watched, I have seen the same thing. I wish I could tell my best friend that I love him, and that I forgive him. I wished that I could tell him that I know he is jealous of me, and that I wish he could be happy.
