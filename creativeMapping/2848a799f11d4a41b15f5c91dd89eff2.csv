One day a small group of us, me and 4 others, decided to plot our escape. We were tired of being locked up. So one evening when everyone else was asleep, I broke a large window, and the 5 of us escaped. An alarm went off, but we stole a car and were miles down the road before any of the guards noticed. We drove for days, and when we were sure we were safe, we stopped at a small town to rest. We stopped at a motel but we hadn't thought of how we would get around without getting caught. As the 5 of us were brainstorming in the car we were startled by a knock at the window. It was another ""Lost Generation"" member! I could tell by the gray hair on her head. She welcomed us inside. ""You're home,"" she told us as we sat down in the lobby chairs with here. We were each given a new immortality drug that the young didn't know about. It turns out we landed in a town filled with the ""lost"" who had all escaped like we did. With this drug created by one of the Lost we were also able to live forever.
