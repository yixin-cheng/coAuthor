They took him to their home planet called Xexor, a place that would rank up there near the top of the list of places you should never go.

So, the humans had to develop a plan to get him back. Oh boy, did they have a great plan to. The humans had planned to create a clone of Matt Damon and let the aliens believe they had taken the clone, when in reality they will have taken away the real Matt Damon. The aliens learned about this clone, but did not know the clone was on Earth. So the aliens, who wanted the real Matt Damon , sent out two of their best space ships to Earth in hopes of snatching the clone (who they didn't know was a clone), and replace him with the real Matt Damon (who they did know was the real Matt Damon). 
The humans knew the aliens would try to take the clone, so they developed a plan in which they would hide him inside a building and let
 the aliens believe that they were trying to protect him, when in fact they were not. So the aliens showed up with their ships, and in a covert mission swapped the two Matt Damons. 

The humans pretended they had no idea, when they knew all along. Now the humans had Matt Damon back, and the aliens thought they had the real on. Of course they didn't",user,17,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
