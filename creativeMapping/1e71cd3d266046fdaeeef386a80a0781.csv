They hit upon an ingenious stratagem: in order to grow stronger, they need to expose a single human to all the world's mana, and tap into the energy of that single human soul. They develop a chamber made of a material that can contain mana, and a brave individual volunteers to remain inside.  his chamber is called the Transference Chamber.
 The volunteer who will receive all the mana, will be known as the Conduit.

So as alien bombardment continues, and the situation growing increasingly perilous, mana flows into the Transference Chamber, and the Conduit absorbs it. The effects are rapid. The Conduit rapidly begins to evolve, becoming a Mana user capable of superhuman feats of magic. These powers grow as the mana exposure continues, and very quickly, he reaches a level of power that might be sufficient to tap. The experimenters release him from the Transference Chamber.

ut there is one problem.
 The Conduit refuses to have his soul tapped.  His power, as well as his thought, have evolved beyond human ken. He has become an otherworldly being in human guise. With a wave of one hand, he destroys all the alien forces. The researchers are grateful, they believe they have been saved. But the Conduit is not human, and the remains of humanity are no more kin to him than the aliens were. He waves his other hand, and destroys the pitiful remains of humanity. Alone now,  but not for long, The Conduit ventures out into the universe to shape it in his own image.",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
