This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning.

You pick up the phone and call that number and a familiar voice picks up. It sounds like JFK but that's obviously impossible. He's been dead for decades. The person on the other line tells you that he is John F Kennedy. He was the President of the United States at one time. You explain to him that that is impossible as JFK has been dead for over 25 years.

The person on the other line explains that the death was staged. It wasn't even staged that well which is why there is the 2 shooter theory that we have seen on the internet previously.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning.

You pick up the phone and call that number and a familiar voice picks up. It sounds like JFK but that's obviously impossible. He's been dead for decades.

You pick up the phone and call that number and a familiar voice picks up. It sounds like JFK but that's obviously impossible. He's been dead for decades. The person on the other line tells you that he is John F Kennedy. He was the President of the United States at one time. You explain to him that that is impossible as JFK has been dead for over 25 years.

The person on the other line explains that the death was staged. It wasn't even staged that well which is why there is the 2 shooter theory that we have seen on the internet previously.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning. 

You get to the bottom of it and ask JFK what exactly he needs from you. You ask why he needs you to fly to him.

JFK explains that the purpose of you coming to visit him is to get off the grid as well. JFK explains that he knows the stress that comes with being President of the United States. He knows what it's like to always be in the limelight. 

You think it over and explain to JFK while you greatly appreciate the offer, you think it's too risky. You also don't want to blow up JFKs spot. You politely decline and JFK tells you the offer is always on the table.

You pick up the phone and call that number and a familiar voice picks up. It sounds like JFK but that's obviously impossible. He's been dead for decades. The person on the other line tells you that he is John F Kennedy. He was the President of the United States at one time. You explain to him that that is impossible as JFK has been dead for over 25 years.

The person on the other line explains that the death was staged. It wasn't even staged that well which is why there is the 2 shooter theory that we have seen on the internet previously.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning. 

You get to the bottom of it and ask JFK what exactly he needs from you. You ask why he needs you to fly to him.

JFK explains that the purpose of you coming to visit him is to get off the grid as well. JFK explains that he knows the stress that comes with being President of the United States. He knows what it's like to always be in the limelight. 

You think it over and explain to JFK while you greatly appreciate the offer, you think it's too risky. You also don't want to blow up JFKs spot. You politely decline and JFK tells you the offer is always on the table.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning. 

You get to the bottom of it and ask JFK what exactly he needs from you. You ask why he needs you to fly to him.

JFK explains that the purpose of you coming to visit him is to get off the grid as well. JFK explains that he knows the stress that comes with being President of the United States. He knows what it's like to always be in the limelight. 

You think it over and explain to JFK while you greatly appreciate the offer, you think it's too risky. You also don't want to blow up JFKs spot. You politely decline and JFK tells you the offer is always on the table.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

You realize that this has to be a joke since it's signed JFK. You want to get to the bottom of it and figure out who is messing around with you. You go through your regular days routine and nothing is unusual at all. The problem is, as the day goes on your curiosity gets the best of you.

You pick up the phone and call that number and a familiar voice picks up. It sounds like JFK but that's obviously impossible. He's been dead for decades. The person on the other line tells you that he is John F Kennedy. He was the President of the United States at one time. You explain to him that that is impossible as JFK has been dead for over 25 years.

The person on the other line explains that the death was staged. It wasn't even staged that well which is why there is the 2 shooter theory that we have seen on the internet previously.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning. 

You get to the bottom of it and ask JFK what exactly he needs from you. You ask why he needs you to fly to him.
