ou call the number and are greeted by a woman's voice.
  She has a very calming tone, and she assures you that this is not a trick.   She simply needs you to do one thing to prove your identity: tell her the name of the butler at the White House.

For you, this is a very simple task, so you are able to verify your identity easily.  Satisfied that you really are the former president, she begins to read from what sounds like a prepared script.

  She has a very calming tone, and she assures you that this is not a trick.   She simply needs you to do one thing to prove your identity: tell her the name of the butler at the White House.

For you, this is a very simple task, so you are able to verify your identity easily.  Satisfied that you really are the former president, she begins to read from what sounds like a prepared script.

ou call the number and are greeted by a woman's voice.
  She has a very calming tone, and she assures you that this is not a trick.   She simply needs you to do one thing to prove your identity: tell her the name of the butler at the White House.

For you, this is a very simple task, so you are able to verify your identity easily.  Satisfied that you really are the former president, she begins to read from what sounds like a prepared script.
""You're about to be contacted by several people, from several different agencies."" she begins.  ""You are uniquely qualified, and they require your expertise.""

ou call the number and are greeted by a woman's voice.
  She has a very calming tone, and she assures you that this is not a trick.   She simply needs you to do one thing to prove your identity: tell her the name of the butler at the White House.

For you, this is a very simple task, so you are able to verify your identity easily.  Satisfied that you really are the former president, she begins to read from what sounds like a prepared script.
""You're about to be contacted by several people, from several different agencies."" she begins.  ""You are uniquely qualified, and they require your expertise.""

You have lots of questions, but the woman on the phone just keeps talking.
""If you decide to join our agency, you will not be paid the typical salary.
  But you will be very pleased with the level of compensation""

You were starting to get a little bored on the beaches in Hawai'i, so you decide to hear her out.
""As you know, our country faces some unique threats-""
 as if she even needed to tell you, ""and you have a perfect opportunity to help those who will accept your help"".  

This is flattering to you, so you encourage her to keep going.  
The rest of the call is pretty basic, and you decide to accept her offer.
  You can't wait to see who these agencies are.

She tells you to pack your bags, and head to the nearest hangar.  
You've arrived at an airport hangar, and as instructed, you have come alone.

The next person to speak gives the same generic pitch, but this time, you ask him what agency he represents.

He gives a name, and you recognize it from one of your contacts in Hollywood.  It's a talent agency!

hese are the two choices you have to make.: you can either help the nation by writing another book, or you can go onto the talk-show circuit.  Both are highly lucrative, but you seem a bit disappointed.

You've arrived at an airport hangar, and as instructed, you have come alone.
  A private jet arrives, and the same woman from the phone greets you from the stairs and invites you aboard.

On board the jet, are numerous impeccably dressed men and women, all representing different agencies.  
The first woman you encounter is an attractive redhead.
  She's not your type, but she is eager to talk to you.  

She goes into the same generic pitch about the problems facing the nation, and asks you to help.  So, what do you think?""
  She asks.  You are so eager to help, that you sign up and ask what you can do first.  

That is when she hands you the outline for your next book.Y""ou're a prominent author, and your next book is about to hit the shelves.
""  She tells you.  ""It's exactly what our country needs"".

The next person to speak gives the same generic pitch, but this time, you ask him what agency he represents.

He gives a name, and you recognize it from one of your contacts in Hollywood.  It's a talent agency!

hese are the two choices you have to make.: you can either help the nation by writing another book, or you can go onto the talk-show circuit.  Both are highly lucrative, but you seem a bit disappointed.

The woman from the phone seems to notice your mood, and she kindly asks you what you thought former Presidents did with their free time.  ""Oh, by the way, she says",user,41,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

ou call the number and are greeted by a woman's voice.
  She has a very calming tone, and she assures you that this is not a trick.   She simply needs you to do one thing to prove your identity: tell her the name of the butler at the White House.

For you, this is a very simple task, so you are able to verify your identity easily.  Satisfied that you really are the former president, she begins to read from what sounds like a prepared script.
""You're about to be contacted by several people, from several different agencies."" she begins.  ""You are uniquely qualified, and they require your expertise.""

You have lots of questions, but the woman on the phone just keeps talking.
""If you decide to join our agency, you will not be paid the typical salary.
  But you will be very pleased with the level of compensation""

You were starting to get a little bored on the beaches in Hawai'i, so you decide to hear her out.
""As you know, our country faces some unique threats-""
 as if she even needed to tell you, ""and you have a perfect opportunity to help those who will accept your help"".  

This is flattering to you, so you encourage her to keep going.  
The rest of the call is pretty basic, and you decide to accept her offer.

  She has a very calming tone, and she assures you that this is not a trick.   She simply needs you to do one thing to prove your identity: tell her the name of the butler at the White House.

For you, this is a very simple task, so you are able to verify your identity easily.  Satisfied that you really are the former president, she begins to read from what sounds like a prepared script.
