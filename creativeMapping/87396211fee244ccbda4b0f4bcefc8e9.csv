Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You look down and see a bee wearing a tiny cap and vest. You ask the bee what he wants and the bee tells you that you are now the leader of their bee army.

The bee tells you that he needs your help at saving the largest bee colony in the world. The bee stung you and that made you the leader of the bee army. You are one of them now. They need your help badly. The bee explains to you that if you help him and his fellow bees, you will no longer be deathly allergic. You won't be allergic at all.

You ask the bee how you're even alive considering he is a bee and he stung you. The bee explains that he is a royal bee and his stinger can't kill anyone. His stinger signifies friendship and loyalty. 

You ask the bee how you're even going to be able to help. The bee tells you that they need a strong man to chop open a wooden fences blockade. Since they are bees they are unable to hold an ax.

If you can wield the ax and break the blockade, all of the bees can escape and live their life freely again.

These bees are part of the biggest colony in the world and they are being kept captive by an evil man. He is using the bees to create honey that he can sell all across the world. The man is rich and the bees are tired and overworked. Some have even died from the amount of work they're being asked to do.

The bees fly towards where the bees are being kept captive and you see a really thick piece of wood. There's no way to remove the wood and you have to chop through it to open up the door. 

You wield the ax and swing it for the first time and to your surprise, you take a big chunk of wood right out of the middle. You swing the ax again and another big chunk flies out. You swing the ax one more time with all of your might and the wooden blockade snaps in half. There is now no barrier that can prevent you from opening the door and freeing the bees.

You ask the bee what he wants and the bee tells you that you are now the leader of their bee army.

The bee tells you that he needs your help at saving the largest bee colony in the world. The bee stung you and that made you the leader of the bee army. You are one of them now. They need your help badly. The bee explains to you that if you help him and his fellow bees, you will no longer be deathly allergic. You won't be allergic at all.

You ask the bee how you're even going to be able to help. The bee tells you that they need a strong man to chop open a wooden fences blockade. Since they are bees they are unable to hold an ax.

If you can wield the ax and break the blockade, all of the bees can escape and live their life freely again.

These bees are part of the biggest colony in the world and they are being kept captive by an evil man. He is using the bees to create honey that he can sell all across the world. The man is rich and the bees are tired and overworked. Some have even died from the amount of work they're being asked to do.

You swing the ax one more time with all of your might and the wooden blockade snaps in half. There is now no barrier that can prevent you from opening the door and freeing the bees.

The bee tells you that he needs your help at saving the largest bee colony in the world. The bee stung you and that made you the leader of the bee army. You are one of them now.

You ask the bee how you're even going to be able to help. The bee tells you that they need a strong man to chop open a wooden fences blockade. Since they are bees they are unable to hold an ax.

If you can wield the ax and break the blockade, all of the bees can escape and live their life freely again.

These bees are part of the biggest colony in the world and they are being kept captive by an evil man. He is using the bees to create honey that he can sell all across the world.

If you can wield the ax and break the blockade, all of the bees can escape and live their life freely again.

These bees are part of the biggest colony in the world and they are being kept captive by an evil man. He is using the bees to create honey that he can sell all across the world. The man is rich and the bees are tired and overworked. Some have even died from the amount of work they're being asked to do.

The bees fly towards where the bees are being kept captive and you see a really thick piece of wood. There's no way to remove the wood and you have to chop through it to open up the door. 

You wield the ax and swing it for the first time and to your surprise, you take a big chunk of wood right out of the middle. You swing the ax again and another big chunk flies out. You swing the ax one more time with all of your might and the wooden blockade snaps in half. There is now no barrier that can prevent you from opening the door and freeing the bees. 

You open the door and all of the bees fly out. You have successfully rescued them and have saved their lives.

The bee tells you that he needs your help at saving the largest bee colony in the world. The bee stung you and that made you the leader of the bee army. You are one of them now. They need your help badly. The bee explains to you that if you help him and his fellow bees, you will no longer be deathly allergic. You won't be allergic at all.

You ask the bee how you're even alive considering he is a bee and he stung you. The bee explains that he is a royal bee and his stinger can't kill anyone. His stinger signifies friendship and loyalty. 

You ask the bee how you're even going to be able to help. The bee tells you that they need a strong man to chop open a wooden fences blockade. Since they are bees they are unable to hold an ax.

If you can wield the ax and break the blockade, all of the bees can escape and live their life freely again.

These bees are part of the biggest colony in the world and they are being kept captive by an evil man. He is using the bees to create honey that he can sell all across the world. The man is rich and the bees are tired and overworked. Some have even died from the amount of work they're being asked to do.

You wield the ax and swing it for the first time and to your surprise, you take a big chunk of wood right out of the middle. You swing the ax again and another big chunk flies out. You swing the ax one more time with all of your might and the wooden blockade snaps in half. There is now no barrier that can prevent you from opening the door and freeing the bees. 

You open the door and all of the bees fly out. You have successfully rescued them and have saved their lives.

The bee tells you that he needs your help at saving the largest bee colony in the world. The bee stung you and that made you the leader of the bee army. You are one of them now. They need your help badly. The bee explains to you that if you help him and his fellow bees, you will no longer be deathly allergic. You won't be allergic at all.

You ask the bee how you're even alive considering he is a bee and he stung you. The bee explains that he is a royal bee and his stinger can't kill anyone. His stinger signifies friendship and loyalty.

You swing the ax one more time with all of your might and the wooden blockade snaps in half. There is now no barrier that can prevent you from opening the door and freeing the bees. 

You open the door and all of the bees fly out. You have successfully rescued them and have saved their lives.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You look down and see a bee wearing a tiny cap and vest. You ask the bee what he wants and the bee tells you that you are now the leader of their bee army.

The bee tells you that he needs your help at saving the largest bee colony in the world. The bee stung you and that made you the leader of the bee army. You are one of them now. They need your help badly. The bee explains to you that if you help him and his fellow bees, you will no longer be deathly allergic. You won't be allergic at all.

You ask the bee how you're even alive considering he is a bee and he stung you. The bee explains that he is a royal bee and his stinger can't kill anyone. His stinger signifies friendship and loyalty. 

You ask the bee how you're even going to be able to help. The bee tells you that they need a strong man to chop open a wooden fences blockade. Since they are bees they are unable to hold an ax.

If you can wield the ax and break the blockade, all of the bees can escape and live their life freely again.

These bees are part of the biggest colony in the world and they are being kept captive by an evil man. He is using the bees to create honey that he can sell all across the world. The man is rich and the bees are tired and overworked. Some have even died from the amount of work they're being asked to do.

The bees fly towards where the bees are being kept captive and you see a really thick piece of wood. There's no way to remove the wood and you have to chop through it to open up the door. 

You wield the ax and swing it for the first time and to your surprise, you take a big chunk of wood right out of the middle. You swing the ax again and another big chunk flies out. You swing the ax one more time with all of your might and the wooden blockade snaps in half. There is now no barrier that can prevent you from opening the door and freeing the bees. 

You open the door and all of the bees fly out. You have successfully rescued them and have saved their lives. 

The bee that originally stung you flies up to you and tells you that you will no longer be allergic to bees. He also tells you that they are so grateful they are going to give you a life time supply of honey. Whenever you need it, just contact the bee and a jar of honey will be yours.
