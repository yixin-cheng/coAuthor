You look to your wife, Michelle, who has read the letter over your shoulder (no secrets are kept between the two of you) and she smiles this secret smile and holds up an envelope of her own. 
""I've been waiting for this day for a long time, Barack.
 I was handed this letter on the last day of your presidency. I've been waiting for you to be ready."" 

The letter inside of Michelle's envelope simply states ""don't worry, your family will be joining you. This is a GOOD thing!"" and was again signed with ""JFK"". 

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife. 
You look to your wife, who is still smiling and nods.

You look to your wife, Michelle, who has read the letter over your shoulder (no secrets are kept between the two of you) and she smiles this secret smile and holds up an envelope of her own. 
""I've been waiting for this day for a long time, Barack.
 I was handed this letter on the last day of your presidency. I've been waiting for you to be ready."" 

The letter inside of Michelle's envelope simply states ""don't worry, your family will be joining you. This is a GOOD thing!"" and was again signed with ""JFK"". 

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife.

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

You look to your wife, Michelle, who has read the letter over your shoulder (no secrets are kept between the two of you) and she smiles this secret smile and holds up an envelope of her own. 
""I've been waiting for this day for a long time, Barack.
 I was handed this letter on the last day of your presidency. I've been waiting for you to be ready."" 

The letter inside of Michelle's envelope simply states ""don't worry, your family will be joining you. This is a GOOD thing!"" and was again signed with ""JFK"". 

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife.

The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife.

The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife.

The letter inside of Michelle's envelope simply states ""don't worry, your family will be joining you. This is a GOOD thing!"" and was again signed with ""JFK"". 

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife. 
You look to your wife, who is still smiling and nods.

You look to your wife, Michelle, who has read the letter over your shoulder (no secrets are kept between the two of you) and she smiles this secret smile and holds up an envelope of her own. 
""I've been waiting for this day for a long time, Barack.
 I was handed this letter on the last day of your presidency. I've been waiting for you to be ready."" 

The letter inside of Michelle's envelope simply states ""don't worry, your family will be joining you. This is a GOOD thing!"" and was again signed with ""JFK"". 

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife. 
You look to your wife, who is still smiling and nods.

You look to your wife, Michelle, who has read the letter over your shoulder (no secrets are kept between the two of you) and she smiles this secret smile and holds up an envelope of her own. 
""I've been waiting for this day for a long time, Barack.
 I was handed this letter on the last day of your presidency. I've been waiting for you to be ready."" 

The letter inside of Michelle's envelope simply states ""don't worry, your family will be joining you. This is a GOOD thing!"" and was again signed with ""JFK"". 

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife.

You glance between the letters and your wife, who is still smiling with her eyebrows arched. She holds out a hand, which you hold tight too as she pulls you into the next room. Your daughters and Sunny, your surviving pup are waiting next to several bags and Sunny's favourite toy. 

You realize that if your family knows what is going on and are comfortable with it, you should be too. They have never failed you, they've been through, and supported you, through every tough time. So you choose to follow them out of the house and into the waiting car. The car that is being driven by a chauffer who is oddly familiar, but not of your usual security detail. The chauffer who grins as he glances back and said ""he's finally ready?"" while sending a wink at your wife. 
You look to your wife, who is still smiling and nods.
 As the car drives away, you ask just one word. 

""Mars?""
To which Michelle nods, the girls laugh and even Sunny barks. ou look back at the house, you' know it's the last time you'll see it. But you have never been more excited for an adventure and knowing that the mysterious JFK will be with you? Well, why would you even think twice about going.
