The 92nd little pig was like, ""No way, wolf.
 You'll eat me up and poop me out.""
The wolf was like, ""No, I won't.
 I have had dental surgery and my mouth is totally paralyzed."" So the pig let the wolf in.
The wolf drank the cup of tea and said, ""LWhere are the biskies?""
 

The 92nd little pig said, ""There are some Digestifs. Would you like one?""

""Thanks, "" said the wolf.

The pig handed him a rectangular cookie. The wolf bit into it.

""AAARRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!"" The wolf cried out.
""What's wrong?"" asked the 92nd little pig.


""MMMMFFFFGGGG HMMMGGGUUUUFFFFFH, MMMMOOOOOFFFFF"" spat the wolf.  Bits of his teeth spread around the room in satisfying geometric swirls.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The 92nd little pig's house was so strong that the wolf couldn't blow it down.
 So he had to get creative. He went to the 92nd little pig's house and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in. All I want is a cup of tea.""
The 92nd little pig was like, ""No way, wolf.
 You'll eat me up and poop me out.""
The wolf was like, ""No, I won't.
 I have had dental surgery and my mouth is totally paralyzed."" So the pig let the wolf in.
The wolf drank the cup of tea and said, ""LWhere are the bikkies?""
 

The 92nd little pig said, ""There are some Digestives. Would you like one?""

""Thanks, "" said the wolf.

The pig handed him a rectangular cookie. The wolf bit into it.

""AAARRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!"" The wolf cried out.
""What's wrong?"" asked the 92nd little pig.


""MMMMFFFFGGGG HMMMGGGUUUUFFFFFH, MMMMOOOOOFFFFF"" spat the wolf.  Bits of his teeth spread around the room in satisfying geometric swirls.
""Oh, I'm sorry,"" said the 92nd little pig.
 ""You asked for a bikkie, and I think I gave you a piece of depleted Uranium instead!""
""Mmmff, MMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMM MMMM MMMMMM MM MM

 ""Can't properly hear you. Well it's time for you to go."" And the pig gave the sputtering wolf a shove through the door.
