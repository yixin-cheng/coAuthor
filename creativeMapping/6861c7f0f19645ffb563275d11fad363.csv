He had contacts in eastern Europe that would pay a lot of money for even a little bit of the stuff. He went home and called one of them and asked them how much he would give the wolf for some. The wolf's contact said ""I'll give you $100,000 for a pound of it."" The wolf liked the sound of that so he went back to see the little pig to see if they could make a deal. ""Hey, little pig, can you get any more of this depleted uranium stuff?"" he asked. ""Sure, I can get a lot more of it if you want it."" the little pig replied. ""Well, I know people that will pay a lot of money for it"" said the wolf ""we can both be rich"". So the little pig and the wolf went into business together selling depleted uranium to shady eastern European contacts. The wolf was happy he didn't try to eat this little wolf, their business arrangement was much too profitable for that.  j",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

text-delete,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" He wondered how the little pig even had access to that kind of material. He asked the little pig ""where did you get this stuff from?"". The little pig said ""I got it from the government."" ""What are you some kind of military contractor or something?"" the wolf asked. ""Something like that, why are you so interested?"" replied the little pig. ""I'm just curious, that's all."" said the wolf. But the wolf had more than just a passing interest in depleted uranium. He had contacts in eastern Europe that would pay a lot of money for even a little bit of the stuff. He went home and called one of them and asked them how much they would give the wolf for some. The wolf's contact said ""I'll give you $100,000 for a pound of it."" The wolf liked the sound of that so he went back to see the little pig to see if they could make a deal. ""Hey, little pig, can you get any more of this depleted uranium stuff?"" he asked. ""Sure, I can get a lot more of it if you want it."" the little pig replied. ""Well, I know people that will pay a lot of money for it"" said the wolf ""we can both be rich"". So the little pig and the wolf went into business together selling depleted uranium to shady eastern European contacts.
