'Gentlemen, please calm down. We are trying to help you, but we can't if you won't cooperate. ' He pauses, then continues.  If you watch the film closely, we've offered you several opportunities to change your life for the better, and you have only yourselves to blame if you don't take advantage of those opportunities.'

'Look, I realize this seems hopeless, but this is a second chance, and we've given you an incalculable amount of these, and so far, you've yet to take us up on it. Just keep watching the film, and maybe this time it''ll turn out different.' Many in the crowd continue to mutter angrily, and some, including yourself, heckle him.

You get a miserable office job, same as you remember, and soon you're trapped in a loveless marriage, and all of this looks awfully familiar.

They start shouting and milling towards the exits. The lights come on, and a man in a white shirt steps out onto the stage, holding an antiquated wireless microphone. He speaks to the crowd. 'Gentlemen, please calm down. We are trying to help you, but we can't if you won't cooperate. ' He pauses, then continues.  If you watch the film closely, we've offered you several opportunities to change your life for the better, and you have only yourselves to blame if you don't take advantage of those opportunities.'

The crowd remains restless. The man speaks again. 'Look, I realize this seems hopeless, but this is a second chance, and we've given you an incalculable amount of these, and so far, you've yet to take us up on it. Just keep watching the film, and maybe this time it''ll turn out different.' Many in the crowd continue to mutter angrily, and some, including yourself, heckle him.

'If you're really unhappy, we'll open the exit. Those of you who don't like the film, can leave.' The exit door creaks open, and many of the crowd file towards it, including yourself. Upon leaving the theatre, the whole scene changes with disorienting rapidity. You find yourself in a very different place, much hotter, and with no film, or theatre air conditioning, and you know now that *this* is where you will be staying forever.

You reach your teens, and you fall in love with a girl that's very much like the girl you fell in love with before.  You break up with her, move on to new relationships, and go to college.  You find that things in college, also go pretty much the same way that you remember them going, you choose a major that's easy, but useless, and spend the next 4 years getting by with C's and B's in easy classes, and graduate with a worthless degree, and start looking for work.  You get a miserable office job, same as you remember, and soon you're trapped in a loveless marriage, and all of this looks awfully familiar.

You're disappointed to find out that your next life, is pretty much the same as the life that had just passed.  You look at the other people who share your feelings, and you realize that you're all going to have the same life over and over again. The theatre crowd becomes restless. They start shouting and milling towards the exits. The lights come on, and a man in a white shirt steps out onto the stage, holding an antiquated wireless microphone. He speaks to the crowd. 'Gentlemen, please calm down. We are trying to help you, but we can't if you won't cooperate. ' He pauses, then continues.  If you watch the film closely, we've offered you several opportunities to change your life for the better, and you have only yourselves to blame if you don't take advantage of those opportunities.'

The crowd remains restless. The man speaks again. 'Look, I realize this seems hopeless, but this is a second chance, and we've given you an incalculable amount of these, and so far, you've yet to take us up on it. Just keep watching the film, and maybe this time it''ll turn out different.' Many in the crowd continue to mutter angrily, and some, including yourself, heckle him.

'If you're really unhappy, we'll open the exit. Those of you who don't like the film, can leave.' The exit door creaks open, and many of the crowd file towards it, including yourself. Upon leaving the theatre, the whole scene changes with disorienting rapidity. You find yourself in a very different place, much hotter, and with no film, or theatre air conditioning, and you know now that *this* is where you will be staying forever.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.  It begins promisingly enough.  You're born, your childhood is happy, and normal, and at worst, no more traumatic than the one you remember.  You master walking, and speaking, and before long you go to school, and make friends.  You reach your teens, and you fall in love with a girl that's very much like the girl you fell in love with before.  You break up with her, move on to new relationships, and go to college.  You find that things in college, also go pretty much the same way that you remember them going, you choose a major that's easy, but useless, and spend the next 4 years getting by with C's and B's in easy classes, and graduate with a worthless degree, and start looking for work.  You get a miserable office job, same as you remember, and soon you're trapped in a loveless marriage, and all of this looks awfully familiar.

They start shouting and milling towards the exits. The lights come on, and a man in a white shirt steps out onto the stage, holding an antiquated wireless microphone. He speaks to the crowd. 'Gentlemen, please calm down. We are trying to help you, but we can't if you won't cooperate. ' He pauses, then continues.  If you watch the film closely, we've offered you several opportunities to change your life for the better, and you have only yourselves to blame if you don't take advantage of those opportunities.'

The crowd remains restless. The man speaks again. 'Look, I realize this seems hopeless, but this is a second chance, and we've given you an incalculable amount of these, and so far, you've yet to take us up on it. Just keep watching the film, and maybe this time it''ll turn out different.' Many in the crowd continue to mutter angrily, and some, including yourself, heckle him.

'If you're really unhappy, we'll open the exit. Those of you who don't like the film, can leave.' The exit door creaks open, and many of the crowd file towards it, including yourself.

They start shouting and milling towards the exits. The lights come on, and a man in a white shirt steps out onto the stage, holding an antiquated wireless microphone. He speaks to the crowd. 'Gentlemen, please calm down. We are trying to help you, but we can't if you won't cooperate. ' He pauses, then continues.  If you watch the film closely, we've offered you several opportunities to change your life for the better, and you have only yourselves to blame if you don't take advantage of those opportunities.'

The crowd remains restless. The man speaks again. 'Look, I realize this seems hopeless, but this is a second chance, and we've given you an incalculable amount of these, and so far, you've yet to take us up on it. Just keep watching the film, and maybe this time it''ll turn out different.' Many in the crowd continue to mutter angrily, and some, including yourself, heckle him.

'If you're really unhappy, we'll open the exit. Those of you who don't like the film, can leave.' The exit door creaks open, and many of the crowd file towards it, including yourself. Upon leaving the theatre, the whole scene changes with disorienting rapidity. You find yourself in a very different place, much hotter, and with no film, or theatre air conditioning, and you know now that *this* is where you will be staying forever.
