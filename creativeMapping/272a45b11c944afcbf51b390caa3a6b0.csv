It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp.

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others?

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry.

text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks.

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others?

""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.

You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.
 It's this or never leaving home again, dying alone in pain without anyone knowing or dying now.

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.
 It's this or never leaving home again, dying alone in pain without anyone knowing or dying now.

""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.

You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""

You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.

You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already.

You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry.

It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.
 It's this or never leaving home again, dying alone in pain without anyone knowing or dying now.

You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""

And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.
 It's this or never leaving home again, dying alone in pain without anyone knowing or dying now. 

You choose now and jab the needle into your neck. The smell of rose scented lotion wafts past you and you smile as your body relaxes.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.


""Why?!"" you ask, but you know the answer already. 
""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry.
