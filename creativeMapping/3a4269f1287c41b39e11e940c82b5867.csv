He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

""You are focusing on what you look like instead of focusing on how you are acting"", Ted said.  ""In all of your different attempts, Sarah never liked how you behaved.

When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

""You are focusing on what you look like instead of focusing on how you are acting"", Ted said.  ""In all of your different attempts, Sarah never liked how you behaved.

""Another unsuccessful date"", Bill thought to himself.  ""Maybe it is my hair?  Or maybe it is my nose.  I might try to increase my height a few more inches next time.""  Bill was a shapeshifter.  He was a relatively young shapeshifter who is looking for love.  He was a bit of a romantic, and he was always looking for the perfect woman.  He thinks he has found his perfect woman in Sarah.

When shapeshifters are born, they look like regular humans.  They develop like regular humans until they 20th birthday.  That is when they get the ability to shapeshift.  They can change their physical appearance at will.  Bill is now 20 years and 6 months old.  He doesn't even have a year of experience shapeshifting so everything is new to him.

He encountered an older shapeshifter early this year named Ted.  Once shapeshifters turn 20, they also develop the ability to sense another shapeshifter.  Ted has been trying to guide Bill on his shapeshifting journey.  Bill has been very receptive to Ted's guidance.    Bill decided to bring up Sarah to Ted.  When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

""You are focusing on what you look like instead of focusing on how you are acting"", Ted said.  ""In all of your different attempts, Sarah never liked how you behaved.  I think you need to take that as a hint and move on"", Ted said.  Bill thought to himself,  ""I think Ted is right.  I think it is a bit creepy how I have interacted with Sarah.  She obviously doesn't like me.  It is time to just move on.""

He was a relatively young shapeshifter who is looking for love.  He was a bit of a romantic, and he was always looking for the perfect woman.  He thinks he has found his perfect woman in Sarah.

When shapeshifters are born, they look like regular humans.  They develop like regular humans until they 20th birthday.  That is when they get the ability to shapeshift.  They can change their physical appearance at will.  Bill is now 20 years and 6 months old.  He doesn't even have a year of experience shapeshifting so everything is new to him.

He encountered an older shapeshifter early this year named Ted.  Once shapeshifters turn 20, they also develop the ability to sense another shapeshifter.  Ted has been trying to guide Bill on his shapeshifting journey.  Bill has been very receptive to Ted's guidance.    Bill decided to bring up Sarah to Ted.  When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

""You are focusing on what you look like instead of focusing on how you are acting"", Ted said.  ""In all of your different attempts, Sarah never liked how you behaved.  I think you need to take that as a hint and move on"", Ted said.  Bill thought to himself,  ""I think Ted is right.  I think it is a bit creepy how I have interacted with Sarah.  She obviously doesn't like me.  It is time to just move on.""

He encountered an older shapeshifter early this year named Ted.  Once shapeshifters turn 20, they also develop the ability to sense another shapeshifter.  Ted has been trying to guide Bill on his shapeshifting journey.  Bill has been very receptive to Ted's guidance.    Bill decided to bring up Sarah to Ted.  When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

""You are focusing on what you look like instead of focusing on how you are acting"", Ted said.  ""In all of your different attempts, Sarah never liked how you behaved.

He was a relatively young shapeshifter who is looking for love.  He was a bit of a romantic, and he was always looking for the perfect woman.  He thinks he has found his perfect woman in Sarah.

When shapeshifters are born, they look like regular humans.  They develop like regular humans until they 20th birthday.  That is when they get the ability to shapeshift.  They can change their physical appearance at will.  Bill is now 20 years and 6 months old.  He doesn't even have a year of experience shapeshifting so everything is new to him.

He encountered an older shapeshifter early this year named Ted.  Once shapeshifters turn 20, they also develop the ability to sense another shapeshifter.  Ted has been trying to guide Bill on his shapeshifting journey.  Bill has been very receptive to Ted's guidance.    Bill decided to bring up Sarah to Ted.  When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

""You are focusing on what you look like instead of focusing on how you are acting"", Ted said.  ""In all of your different attempts, Sarah never liked how you behaved.  I think you need to take that as a hint and move on"", Ted said.  Bill thought to himself,  ""I think Ted is right.  I think it is a bit creepy how I have interacted with Sarah.  She obviously doesn't like me.  It is time to just move on.""

When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

Ted has been trying to guide Bill on his shapeshifting journey.  Bill has been very receptive to Ted's guidance.    Bill decided to bring up Sarah to Ted.  When Bill told Ted about his different attempts to woo Sarah, he abruptly stopped Bill.  He warned him that he is toying with Sarah by changing into different forms.  He also told Bill that he is focusing on the wrong things.

I think you need to take that as a hint and move on"", Ted said.  Bill thought to himself,  ""I think Ted is right.  I think it is a bit creepy how I have interacted with Sarah.
