So the wolf was like, ""Alright, you asked for it.""  I'm gonna shoot, and shoot, and shoot this cannon until I blow your house down."" And that's just what he did. He shot, and he shot, and he shot that cannon, for days on end, but the depleted uranium house wouldn't even dent. The wolf shrugged. ""Back to the drawing board.""

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""  ""Don't you think you're getting a little carried away?"" The pig eyed the wolf's nearby 120mm smoothbore cannon. ""No, 'dude.' I think this is just about right."" 
So the wolf was like, ""Alright, you asked for it.""  I'm gonna shoot, and shoot, and shoot this cannon until I blow your house down."" And that's just what he did.

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure.

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

So the wolf was like, ""Alright, you asked for it.""  I'm gonna shoot, and shoot, and shoot this cannon until I blow your house down."" And that's just what he did. He shot, and he shot, and he shot that cannon, for days on end, but the depleted uranium house wouldn't even dent. The wolf shrugged. ""Back to the drawing board.""

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""  ""Don't you think you're getting a little carried away?"" The pig eyed the wolf's nearby 120mm smoothbore cannon. ""No, 'dude.' I think this is just about right."" 
So the wolf was like, ""Alright, you asked for it.""  I'm gonna shoot, and shoot, and shoot this cannon until I blow your house down."" And that's just what he did. He shot, and he shot, and he shot that cannon, for days on end, but the depleted uranium house wouldn't even dent. The wolf shrugged. ""Back to the drawing board.""

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""  ""Don't you think you're getting a little carried away?"" The pig eyed the wolf's nearby 120mm smoothbore cannon. ""No, 'dude.' I think this is just about right."" 
So the wolf was like, ""Alright, you asked for it.""  I'm gonna shoot, and shoot, and shoot this cannon until I blow your house down."" And that's just what he did. He shot, and he shot, and he shot that cannon, for days on end, but the depleted uranium house wouldn't even dent. The wolf shrugged. ""Back to the drawing board.""

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

As he was hauled off in shackles, he looked over his shoulder at the pig, and glared. The pig smirked back at him, and said , ""Super-hardened structure, 'dude.' Next time,  try using the right kind of bomb",user,27,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

As he was hauled off in shackles, he looked over his shoulder at the pig, and glared. The pig smirked back at him, and said , ""Super-hardened structure, 'dude.' Next time,  try using the right kind of bomb FIRST.'

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""  ""Don't you think you're getting a little carried away?"" The pig eyed the wolf's nearby 120mm smoothbore cannon. ""No, 'dude.' I think this is just about right."" 
So the wolf was like, ""Alright, you asked for it.""  I'm gonna shoot, and shoot, and shoot this cannon until I blow your house down."" And that's just what he did. He shot, and he shot, and he shot that cannon, for days on end, but the depleted uranium house wouldn't even dent. The wolf shrugged. ""Back to the drawing board.""

Next, the wolf tried some C4 explosives. Unfortunately for him, the pig had run beams a good 10 feet into the ground, so the foundations held. After that, the wolf tried a wire-guided missile with a shaped explosive warhead, but the depleted uranium house was still too strong. Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

Getting a little frustrated, the wolf called in a precision-guided munition from a B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which surprised the pig, but didn't managed to penetrate the hardened depleted uranium structure. The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

As he was hauled off in shackles, he looked over his shoulder at the pig, and glared. The pig smirked back at him, and said , ""Super-hardened structure, 'dude.' Next time,  try using the right kind of bomb FIRST.'
