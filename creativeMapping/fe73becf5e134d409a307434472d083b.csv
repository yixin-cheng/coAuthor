""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd. That afternoon you get on a plane for Miami, where you are going to a fundraising dinner that evening. You check into the hotel, and when you put your bags on the bed you see another note on the bedside table. 
""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events.

""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd. That afternoon you get on a plane for Miami, where you are going to a fundraising dinner that evening. You check into the hotel, and when you put your bags on the bed you see another note on the bedside table. 
""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events.

And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd.

 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd. That afternoon you get on a plane for Miami, where you are going to a fundraising dinner that evening. You check into the hotel, and when you put your bags on the bed you see another note on the bedside table. 
""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd. That afternoon you get on a plane for Miami, where you are going to a fundraising dinner that evening. You check into the hotel, and when you put your bags on the bed you see another note on the bedside table. 
""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

As you exit the car, and prepare to head towards you new ""job"" you turn to JFK. ""So are you ""our"" JFK? Did you not re",user,41,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd.

 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd.

""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events.

Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd. That afternoon you get on a plane for Miami, where you are going to a fundraising dinner that evening. You check into the hotel, and when you put your bags on the bed you see another note on the bedside table. 
""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary.

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

As you exit the car, and prepare to head towards you new ""job"" you turn to JFK. ""So are you ""our"" JFK? Did you not really die? Or are you another JFK? What really happened?"" JFK just smiles.

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day.

You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events.

 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

As you exit the car, and prepare to head towards you new ""job"" you turn to JFK. ""So are you ""our"" JFK? Did you not really die? Or are you another JFK? What really happened?"" JFK just smiles. 

""Maybe I'll tell you when you get back.""

""Not funny Michelle."" you think as you get up and head to the kitchen for coffee. 
The rest of the day goes by in a blur.
 Your wife and kids left the house shortly after you got up and you haven't even seen then all day. You spoke Michelle of course and mentioned the ""joke"" but she acted like she had no idea what you were talking about. That was a bit odd. That afternoon you get on a plane for Miami, where you are going to a fundraising dinner that evening. You check into the hotel, and when you put your bags on the bed you see another note on the bedside table. 
""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

As you exit the car, and prepare to head towards you new ""job"" you turn to JFK. ""So are you ""our"" JFK? Did you not really die? Or are you another JFK? What really happened?"" JFK just smiles.

""Call the number listed, no matter what time of day or night."" And I hope you packed enough. JFK
 
You decide to call it.
 It has to be some sort of prank coordinated by your wife and Secret Service agents guarding you. No way these notes are getting placed otherwise. Probably meant to lightened your spirits - you've been awfully discouraged about recent events. 
The phone rings twice before someone answers.
 A voice you've heard a hundred times, but never live, is on the other end. ""Finally Barack. Now let's get back to work.""

Now, a knock on the door. You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. ""I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works."" 

He briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and ""borrowing"" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. 

""Don't worry,"" says JFK ""You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.""

As you exit the car, and prepare to head towards you new ""job"" you turn to JFK. ""So are you ""our"" JFK? Did you not really die? Or are you another JFK? What really happened?"" JFK just smiles.
