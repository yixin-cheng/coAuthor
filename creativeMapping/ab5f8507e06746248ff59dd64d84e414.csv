 At least, that was the original idea behind it. The company that made them wanted to do this as a fun campaign to draw attention to the mugs. People just bought them as a silly novelty item so something had to be done to bring them back to life on social media. 
But when they changed the mug rankings, they didn't expect people to treat it so seriously.
 They were amazed at the amount of people who called them to complain that they had been personally offended by the new mug rankings. The company was happy that so many people were talking about the mugs. They were just surprised that people felt so extreme about it. 
There are even people who have bought the mug on purpose to taunt their wives and mothers-in-law.
 People were finding new uses for the mugs. Sales were through the roof. The newest craze was showing your ranking, good or bad. People were pretty desperate for attention these days after all.

But when they changed the mug rankings, they didn't expect people to treat it so seriously.
 They were amazed at the amount of people who called them to complain that they had been personally offended by the new mug rankings. The company was happy that so many people were talking about the mugs. They were just surprised that people felt so extreme about it. 
There are even people who have bought the mug on purpose to taunt their wives and mothers-in-law.

 At least, that was the original idea behind it. The company that made them wanted to do this as a fun campaign to draw attention to the mugs. People just bought them as a silly novelty item so something had to be done to bring them back to life on social media. 
But when they changed the mug rankings, they didn't expect people to treat it so seriously.
 They were amazed at the amount of people who called them to complain that they had been personally offended by the new mug rankings. The company was happy that so many people were talking about the mugs. They were just surprised that people felt so extreme about it. 
There are even people who have bought the mug on purpose to taunt their wives and mothers-in-law.
 People were finding new uses for the mugs. Sales were through the roof. The newest craze was showing your ranking, good or bad. People were pretty desperate for attention these days after all. 
The company still has very high hopes for the campaign.
 They believed this was just the start. They could now use all of this interest and start producing mugs for moms, for children, for bosses. Everyone would get a ranking.
By the end of the year, there will be entire sets of ""Best Mom"", ""Most Handsome Dad"", and ""Bossiest

 At least, that was the original idea behind it. The company that made them wanted to do this as a fun campaign to draw attention to the mugs. People just bought them as a silly novelty item so something had to be done to bring them back to life on social media. 
But when they changed the mug rankings, they didn't expect people to treat it so seriously.
 They were amazed at the amount of people who called them to complain that they had been personally offended by the new mug rankings. The company was happy that so many people were talking about the mugs. They were just surprised that people felt so extreme about it.

 At least, that was the original idea behind it. The company that made them wanted to do this as a fun campaign to draw attention to the mugs. People just bought them as a silly novelty item so something had to be done to bring them back to life on social media. 
But when they changed the mug rankings, they didn't expect people to treat it so seriously.
 They were amazed at the amount of people who called them to complain that they had been personally offended by the new mug rankings. The company was happy that so many people were talking about the mugs. They were just surprised that people felt so extreme about it. 
There are even people who have bought the mug on purpose to taunt their wives and mothers-in-law.
 People were finding new uses for the mugs. Sales were through the roof. The newest craze was showing your ranking, good or bad. People were pretty desperate for attention these days after all. 
The company still has very high hopes for the campaign.
 They believed this was just the start. They could now use all of this interest and start producing mugs for moms, for children, for bosses. Everyone would get a ranking.
By the end of the year, there will be entire sets of ""Best Mom"", ""Most Handsome Dad"", and ""Bossiest
 boss"". The possibilities really are endless. nce this campaign is done, people will be seeing tte mug rankings everywhere.
 The company will have an oversaturation issue where people won't be needing or wanting any more of these mugs for a long time. It didn't matter though, they'd have enough money from this that they'd do fine financially until then. 

So they company released every possible self ranking mug possible. Every person and animals ended up getting a personalized ranking. Eventually the rankings just became meaningless because the next social media craze hit. Short attention spans are to be expected these days
