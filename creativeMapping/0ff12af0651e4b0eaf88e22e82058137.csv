A world-wide society of mutants has emerged and are now the way of life.

It was amazing how quickly things crumbled. It had only been 50 years after all. But, mankind had changed. If you could really even call it that. Decisions had to be made. Should we go back into exile or try to adapt to this new world? The new creatures seemed to have their own language and their own social structure. There was no more money, everything seemed to work on the barter system. Some nations still wore clothes and seemed to live in towns and cities, but many had reverted back to a wild state and the capitals were nothing more than abandoned crumbling buildings and cities were going back to nature.


A world without the Internet was a hard one for me to adjust to.
 But I saw the changes on the television every night from broadcasts made by the brave souls that went to see this new changed world. I decided that I wanted to be one of them. There was a segment on the local news about a group of people that had decided to go live among some of the more civilized mutants and find out what happened. I suspected they also hoped to bring them more in line with our way of life.

I called the number at the end of the segment and made an appointment to go downtown the next day for a physical and screening. I was nervous as I prepared for the interview, but I had done my homework and knew as much about this new reality as possible. As I packed my bags that night, I knew that sleep would be hard to come by.  But I knew that this was something that I had to do. It was up to me to either figure out how to navigate this new world, or make it fit more like the reality that I remembered. As I fell asleep that night finally, I dreamed of a new world that was fused with my old world and suddenly it didn't seem so scary anymor",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
