It was a golem, made of living stone.
 It was intelligent and possessed an almost reptilian cunning, but there were mysteries about it. It healed from injuries quickly and could seemingly reshape itself. Within a few months it had built an entire city. As more and more of them appeared, some even developed the ability to fly. 

The golems were hostile, and within months they began attacking human and alien settlements in distant star systems. They struck with great savagery and yet seemed to lack any real tactics or strategy. Worse, they had no regard for losses on their own side. All of these things suggested that the golems could not be reasoned with, and would have to be destroyed. 

Mankind's initial efforts to destroy the golems involved a variety of nuclear weapons, but those attacks only made the golems grow more. They reacted to the threat by forming a powerful shield around their cities, which repelled all ordnance, and then they counter-attacked with the most devastating weapon imaginable: A barrage of meteorites. 
Within a matter of weeks, tManyrplanets were educed to an apocalyptic wasteland.
 The golems cut a deadly path through the system. They destroyed every human and alien settlement they encountered. And now, they are headed to Earth! 
It is now up to the combined forces of the world's militaries to put an end to this threat once and for all.
