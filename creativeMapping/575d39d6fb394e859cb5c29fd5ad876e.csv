The other issue faced is that of the annual lottery.  The prospect of winning cash/homes is somewhat dulled by the grim reality being faced. The lottery had it's bad side too, that of decimation of the county of the selected person, by lot. The actual killing of 10% of the counties population, seems quaint now. We need more people not less, giving up of 10% of persons is silly and must be rethought. We need more people not less.

Arnold, the president of US has opined that maybe we need to encourage MORE children and intermixing, NOT less. This idea has resistance but is still sound. His idea of encouraging open borders, to encourage immigration and intermixing is resisted by many. in addition

Japan and China have merged. It's now called Pan China. Unfortunately they have steamrolled the rest of the world. They are an authoritarian government - repressing all who don't toe the party line. They have mandated that all persons be married, and they are required to have 10 children in each family.  The state decides whom will be married to whom. This has resulted into a juggernaut. They are basically unstoppable.

The rest of the world, save the US, have all banded together to fight them. Alas, they seem unstoppable. With so many strong young people available to feed into their military, nothing seems to stop them. They are also leading in technology, right now they are involved in advancing on the former Country called Russia. Some other nations are supporting them, to help check the Asian Pan Chinese.  The harsh plains of Siberia is the location, presently of the conflict. USA is at a loss. Persons in the newly unexiled country are wondering where they fit in. The new tech wielded by Pan China is boggling and there seems no stopping them. The US president, Arnold Swartzenegger seems full of bluster, but the tech and manpower needed to match seem futile.

The lottery had it's bad side too, that of decimation of the county of the selected person, by lot. The actual killing of 10% of the counties population, seems quaint now. We need more people not less, giving up of 10% of persons is silly and must be rethought. We need more people not less. Arnold, the president of US has opined that maybe we need to encourage MORE children and intermixing, NOT less. This idea has resistance but is still sound. His idea of encouraging open borders, to encourage immigration and intermixing is resisted by many. in addition
