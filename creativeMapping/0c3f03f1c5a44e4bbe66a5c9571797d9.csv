 Immediately, Matt Damon's security, which calls themselves the Ninja Rescue Team, realizes he is missing and is ready to take action. The aliens are not ready for the Ninja Rescue Team, as they are a group of ninjas who are ready to fight to the death to get Matt Damon back to safety. The Ninja Rescue Team first had to find where the alien is hiding. They knew that the alien would be hiding in a place that was not easy to find, so they had to think of a plan. They decided to split up and search for the alien. Eventually one of the Ninjas found him hiding in a cave in the wilderness. He had Mr. Damon with him in the cave. The Ninja then had to fight the alien to get Matt Damon back. The alien was really strong so he shouted his special call to get the rest of the Ninjas there to help him.
