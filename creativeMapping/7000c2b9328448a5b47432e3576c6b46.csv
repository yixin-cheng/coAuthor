The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from.
