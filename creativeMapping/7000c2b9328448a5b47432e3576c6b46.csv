This news was devastating to the United States. After coming out and finding out the news, the US formed a special team to try and catch the country back up to pre-war levels. The US government appointed a young man named Brad Armstrong to lead this team. Armstrong had a great experience in the world of motorcycle racing and was seen by officials as the perfect man to lead this team. He was a man that people could look up to in times of crisis and follow their lead. Brad begins to examine the successes of other countries and what the US would have to do in order to catch up. To get accurate information they would need to infiltrate the foreign governments and steal their secrets. Armstrong's job was to locate an agency deep enough in the government to do these espionage missions. 

     His team was a rag-tag group of misfits from other espionage missions in the past. Each member is unique in their own way, but together they make a powerful force that can take on any force. The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries.
