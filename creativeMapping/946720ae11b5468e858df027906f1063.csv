Like Gears of War, the player can also perform rolls by double-tapping either forward or backward direction. The gameplay can be described as something in the old Zelda theme. Not as straightforward but there are a lot of side jobs.There are plenty of ammo and health pickups scattered around the levels, but some areas have no ammo at all, usually in order to make players think about how they want to proceed through the level, although it's not always clear how much to conserve and how much to use. In general, Out of Exile is a well-balanced game, and it's not too difficult to complete even on the hardest difficulty settings.The game is divided into three main campaigns, each one having its own set of levels. Although most of the levels are on-rails and do not allow free roaming around, there are some notable exceptions, one being a mission in which the player controls a tank and the other being a mission which takes place in an abandoned mine. The game is not too hard nor too easy , but most of the players playing it will find great value in their money as it's something really different than everything else on the market.
