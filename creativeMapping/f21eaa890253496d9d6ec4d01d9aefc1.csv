But thinking back on the situation, Soeurette had been with her brother, your best friend, Kaitlyn's husband, that one weekend that you were both out of town at a beer fest. You had ended up getting called onto an emergency work trip that weekend and you had left the beer fest early. You remember that Soeurette had asked you to take a picture of her brother in the beer bikini that she had made for him. She had seemed overly flirtatious with him.

Soeurette comes to ask you what's wrong and you tell her you know that she cheated on you and that Harper is not your child. She denies it at first, but you are able to prove to her that you have figured everything out. She breaks down and confesses her sins. She begs you to try and forgive her.

Your eyes dart from the ranks at the top of list to your mug. You start sweating bullets and you start to feel very uncomfortable. It almost feels like you're having a stroke.

But thinking back on the situation, Soeurette had been with her brother, your best friend, Kaitlyn's husband, that one weekend that you were both out of town at a beer fest. You had ended up getting called onto an emergency work trip that weekend and you had left the beer fest early. You remember that Soeurette had asked you to take a picture of her brother in the beer bikini that she had made for him. She had seemed overly flirtatious with him.

Soeurette comes to ask you what's wrong and you tell her you know that she cheated on you and that Harper is not your child. She denies it at first, but you are able to prove to her that you have figured everything out. She breaks down and confesses her sins. She begs you to try and forgive her.
