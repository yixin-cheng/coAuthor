Obama picks up the pick and dials the number. The man on the other end of the phone tells him to meet him at the White House. The White House? he wonders. Why would he be getting called back to the White House? A car is then sent to pick him up. He reluctantly gets into the car. 
Once Obama arrives at the White House, he's escorted to the Oval Office.
 When he walks into the oval office, he finds JFK standing there waiting for him. ""Welcome back, Mr. President."" Obama said nothing. He was speechless. 
""Would you like a drink Mr. President?
"" He poured himself a cocktail as Obama stood there. ""No, thank you."" he replied politely. ""Well, I'm just gonna go on and get to the point. The country needs your help."" He continued. ""We have received information detailing a plan to overtake the government and start a new fascist regime. You are the only one that can stop them."" Obama sat down. ""I don't know how,"" he said earnestly. ""What makes you think I can do this?"" 

JFK smiled. ""I will show you. First you have to make a choice."" He held out both of his hands and opened them. In each hand was a pill. One was red, the other was white. ""Choose a pill,"" said JFK. ""If you take the red pill, you will become immortal. You will defeat the evildoers, but you will live on forever and see all the aftermath, and never die.""

Obama looked at the white pill. ""What does taking the white pill do?"" JFK shrugged. ""It just makes ya wanna dance all the time and not care about real world problems.""

""I don't know how,"" he said earnestly. ""What makes you think I can do this?"" 

JFK smiled. ""I will show you. First you have to make a choice."" He held out both of his hands and opened them. In each hand was a pill. One was red, the other was white. ""Choose a pill,"" said JFK. ""If you take the red pill, you will become immortal. You will defeat the evildoers, but you will live on forever and see all the aftermath, and never die.""

Obama looked at the white pill. ""What does taking the white pill do?"" JFK shrugged. ""It just makes ya wanna dance all the time and not care about real world problems."" 
Obama thought for a few minutes.
 He reached for the red pill, and then decided he wanted the white pill. All he wanted was to dance, and no one could stop him now.",user,46,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
