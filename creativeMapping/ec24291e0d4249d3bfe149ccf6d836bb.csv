All things considered, you were pretty lucky to have lived to be 85 without being allowed to take the drug. Plenty of others in the ""Lost Generations"" had already passed. 
You were a bit of a rebel in your youth, but you had grown up to be a very responsible adult.
 And while your life may be nearing its end, you children, grandchildren, and other young relatives and friends were all lucky enough to be able to take the immortality/eternal youth drug. So you would say you had a good life.

 Fatal ones. And they were very unpleasant.

 Your children, grandchildren, everyone. There weren't many left in your generation, and most people had taken the drug between the ages of 18 and 21. Which meant that after all the deaths, the it would be left to teenagers to keep the world going. Everything seemed hopeless.

But then, a second scientist suggested that they could use the ""Lost Generations"" as test subjects.
 You volunteered immediately. 
And so, you were injected with a serum that was supposed to cure the side effects.
 And they recorded your body's reaction compared to the the reaction in those that had taken the drug. And then they tried again, and again, using different serums, in different doses, etc. 
And then, one day, they found a serum that worked.

 Your children, grandchildren, everyone. There weren't many left in your generation, and most people had taken the drug between the ages of 18 and 21. Which meant that after all the deaths, the it would be left to teenagers to keep the world going. Everything seemed hopeless. 

But then, a new hope. One scientist suggested that they also do research involving those who had never taken the drug. But experimenting on children? Unacceptable. 
But then, a second scientist suggested that they could use the ""Lost Generations"" as test subjects.
 You volunteered immediately. 
And so, you were injected with a serum that was supposed to cure the side effects.
 And they recorded your body's reaction compared to the the reaction in those that had taken the drug. And then they tried again, and again, using different serums, in different doses, etc. 
And then, one day, they found a serum that worked.
 And it worked for everyone. People still worried about side effects from this new serum, but it was a matter for later. What ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

While keeping them a secret, the government had been working on a cure for the side effects, but it was too late. Nothing seemed to work, and the research results were finally made public; everyone who had taken the drug could expect to die, painfully within the next 2-3 years. 
You were devastated.
 Your children, grandchildren, everyone. There weren't many left in your generation, and most people had taken the drug between the ages of 18 and 21. Which meant that after all the deaths, the it would be left to teenagers to keep the world going. Everything seemed hopeless. 

But then, a new hope. One scientist suggested that they also do research involving those who had never taken the drug. But experimenting on children? Unacceptable. 
But then, a second scientist suggested that they could use the ""Lost Generations"" as test subjects.
 You volunteered immediately. 
And so, you were injected with a serum that was supposed to cure the side effects.
 And they recorded your body's reaction compared to the the reaction in those that had taken the drug. And then they tried again, and again, using different serums, in different doses, etc. 
And then, one day, they found a serum that worked.
 And it worked for everyone. People still worried about side effects from this new serum, but it was a matter for later. 
And so, the world was saved.

All things considered, you were pretty lucky to have lived to be 85 without being allowed to take the drug. Plenty of others in the ""Lost Generations"" had already passed. 
You were a bit of a rebel in your youth, but you had grown up to be a very responsible adult.
 And while your life may be nearing its end, you children, grandchildren, and other young relatives and friends were all lucky enough to be able to take the immortality/eternal youth drug. So you would say you had a good life.

 Your children, grandchildren, everyone. There weren't many left in your generation, and most people had taken the drug between the ages of 18 and 21. Which meant that after all the deaths, the it would be left to teenagers to keep the world going. Everything seemed hopeless. 

But then, a new hope. One scientist suggested that they also do research involving those who had never taken the drug. But experimenting on children? Unacceptable. 
But then, a second scientist suggested that they could use the ""Lost Generations"" as test subjects.
 You volunteered immediately. 
And so, you were injected with a serum that was supposed to cure the side effects.
 And they recorded your body's reaction compared to the the reaction in those that had taken the drug. And then they tried again, and again, using different serums, in different doses, etc. 
And then, one day, they found a serum that worked.
 And it worked for everyone. People still worried about side effects from this new serum, but it was a matter for later.

But then, a second scientist suggested that they could use the ""Lost Generations"" as test subjects.

And then, one day, they found a serum that worked.

 And they recorded your body's reaction compared to the the reaction in those that had taken the drug. And then they tried again, and again, using different serums, in different doses, etc. 
And then, one day, they found a serum that worked.
 And it worked for everyone. People still worried about side effects from this new serum, but it was a matter for later.
