It was what I was going to write down. Incredible.)

As a soul group, all of the souls debate which roles they're going to play in each others' lives. In one life you may be the father of one soul, and then in the next life that same soul may be your father next. Or say that you are the husband and that soul chooses to be the wife. It sounds very strange and it may make you feel weird, but it's possible that it's true. In one life you may even decide to get murdered by someone in your soul group. Why? To just gain experiences in every life to truly understand what it's like to live in various ways. 
The experience of watching each life on the big screen is very enlightening, and you realize how much more value you have in each life when
