Meanwhile, back on Earth, the United States government is attempting to retrieve Matt Damon, and they are forming a team to send to the alien ship.

On the ship, Steven is trying to teach Matt Damon about his species, and their intentions. He explains that they were once warlike, like humans are now, and that they nearly destroyed themselves. Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, the United States government is attempting to retrieve Matt Damon, and they are forming a team to send to the alien ship. The team consists of a group of highly trained soldiers, led by General Casey, who is a huge Matt Damon fan who believes that the aliens are a threat to humanity, as well as his favorite actor. They are sent on a mission to board the alien ship, and given orders to terminate the alien captor with extreme prejudice. The ship is launched, and will reach the alien vessel within a day.

On the ship, Steven is trying to teach Matt Damon about his species, and their intentions. He explains that they were once warlike, like humans are now, and that they nearly destroyed themselves. Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

They are sent on a mission to board the alien ship, and given orders to terminate the alien captor with extreme prejudice. The ship is launched, and will reach the alien vessel within a day.

On the ship, Steven is trying to teach Matt Damon about his species, and their intentions. He explains that they were once warlike, like humans are now, and that they nearly destroyed themselves. Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

Steven, distraught, begins to cry, and the soldiers are confused. He composes himself, and then uses his alien powers to heal Matt Damon, bringing him back to life. The soldiers see that they've made a mistake, and lower their weapons.

Onboard the ship, Steven manages to form a telepathic bond with the actor, and explains to Matt Damon that he was chosen because he was the most famous human on the planet. 

Meanwhile, back on Earth, the United States government is attempting to retrieve Matt Damon, and they are forming a team to send to the alien ship. The team consists of a group of highly trained soldiers, led by General Casey, who is a huge Matt Damon fan who believes that the aliens are a threat to humanity, as well as his favorite actor. They are sent on a mission to board the alien ship, and given orders to terminate the alien captor with extreme prejudice. The ship is launched, and will reach the alien vessel within a day.

On the ship, Steven is trying to teach Matt Damon about his species, and their intentions. He explains that they were once warlike, like humans are now, and that they nearly destroyed themselves. Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

Steven, distraught, begins to cry, and the soldiers are confused. He composes himself, and then uses his alien powers to heal Matt Damon, bringing him back to life. The soldiers see that they've made a mistake, and lower their weapons.

On the ship, Steven is trying to teach Matt Damon about his species, and their intentions. He explains that they were once warlike, like humans are now, and that they nearly destroyed themselves. Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

Steven, distraught, begins to cry, and the soldiers are confused. He composes himself, and then uses his alien powers to heal Matt Damon, bringing him back to life. The soldiers see that they've made a mistake, and lower their weapons.

Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

Steven, distraught, begins to cry, and the soldiers are confused. He composes himself, and then uses his alien powers to heal Matt Damon, bringing him back to life. The soldiers see that they've made a mistake, and lower their weapons.

They are sent on a mission to board the alien ship, and given orders to terminate the alien captor with extreme prejudice. The ship is launched, and will reach the alien vessel within a day.

On the ship, Steven is trying to teach Matt Damon about his species, and their intentions. He explains that they were once warlike, like humans are now, and that they nearly destroyed themselves. Steven tells Matt that they were able to curb their warlike and that they have been searching for other intelligent life for thousands of years. They found humanity, but were appalled to discover that the race was on the verge of wiping itself out through war and pollution.  Steven explains that he will teach humanity how to curb their warlike tendencies,  that his species will help them to become a peaceful race, and that they will share their technology to help usher in an era of peace and prosperity, and  humanity to advance.

While they're talking, the Earth ship collides with and boards the alien one. The team of soldiers, led by General Casey, scour the ship to find Matt and the alien. They encounter resistance from the ship's security systems, but they manage to fight their way through. They breach the door to the area of the ship where Matt and Steven are, and they open fire on the alien. However, Matt Damon jumps in front of the alien, and takes the bullets for him. The actor lies dead at the feet of the alien.

Steven, distraught, begins to cry, and the soldiers are confused. He composes himself, and then uses his alien powers to heal Matt Damon, bringing him back to life. The soldiers see that they've made a mistake, and lower their weapons.
