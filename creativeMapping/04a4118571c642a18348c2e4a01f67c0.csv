I'm feeling seriously weirded out.  I head to the bathroom and then I am conscious of Michelle crying in the next room.  I go in as ask her what is wrong.  She ignores me.  I go and sit beside her and ask again.  Again, she ignores me.  I decide to go and make her a cup of tea.  The girls are sitting at the kitchen table, also crying.  I ask them what is wrong and they don't even glance up let alone respond.  It's like they don't see or hear me.  What is going on here?

I'm feeling seriously weirded out.  I head to the bathroom and then I am conscious of Michelle crying in the next room.  I go in as ask her what is wrong.  She ignores me.
