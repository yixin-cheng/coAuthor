What do you do?


First I rub my eyes.  I roll them.  Another kook letter.  I am surprised it made it into my house.  Usually, these things are diverted to the appropriate authorities.  I wonder how and who left it by my bedside.  I wonder if Michelle left it as a joke, or one of the kids.  I chuckle.  Then, I get the urge to read it again.  I notice that the paper is unusual.  It rather glows.  Then I notice there is a strange cell phone on the bedside table as well.  I pick it up.  The number light is blinking.  I notice it is the same number as the one in the letter.  I am more curious now.  I press send.  A voice comes from the cell phone.  Just pack what you really want to keep and be ready"" the voice says and then cuts the connection.

I'm feeling seriously weirded out.  I head to the bathroom and then I am conscious of Michelle crying in the next room.  I go in as ask her what is wrong.  She ignores me.  I go and sit beside her and ask again.  Again, she ignores me.  I decide to go and make her a cup of tea.  The girls are sitting at the kitchen table, also crying.  I ask them what is wrong and they don't even glance up let alone respond.  It's like they don't see or hear me.  What is going on here?

 feel cold.
  I realize JFK is dead.  It occurs to me I might also be dead!  I try the kitchen wall phone but I can't even lift the receiver, it just stays in place.  That's it I decide, I'm dead and JFK has invited me to join him.  Is this some dead Presidents club?  I start giggling, I'm dead, just like JFK.  Best to follow directions then and pack some stuff.  I go back to the bedroom and see a small glowing bag on the bed.  """,user,45,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What do you do?


First I rub my eyes.  I roll them.  Another kook letter.  I am surprised it made it into my house.  Usually, these things are diverted to the appropriate authorities.  I wonder how and who left it by my bedside.  I wonder if Michelle left it as a joke, or one of the kids.  I chuckle.  Then, I get the urge to read it again.  I notice that the paper is unusual.  It rather glows.  Then I notice there is a strange cell phone on the bedside table as well.  I pick it up.  The number light is blinking.  I notice it is the same number as the one in the letter.  I am more curious now.  I press send.  A voice comes from the cell phone.  Just pack what you really want to keep and be ready"" the voice says and then cuts the connection.

I'm feeling seriously weirded out.  I head to the bathroom and then I am conscious of Michelle crying in the next room.  I go in as ask her what is wrong.  She ignores me.  I go and sit beside her and ask again.  Again, she ignores me.  I decide to go and make her a cup of tea.  The girls are sitting at the kitchen table, also crying.  I ask them what is wrong and they don't even glance up let alone respond.  It's like they don't see or hear me.  What is going on here?

  I realize JFK is dead.  It occurs to me I might also be dead!  I try the kitchen wall phone but I can't even lift the receiver, it just stays in place.  That's it I decide, I'm dead and JFK has invited me to join him.  Is this some dead Presidents club?  I start giggling, I'm dead, just like JFK.  Best to follow directions then and pack some stuff.
