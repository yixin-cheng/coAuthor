I loved cats in my other lives, and I thought I could relate to them. he movie went on to show me that I had been a cat for many years and had lived a happy, complete life.
 I lived with an old woman in a large house, and I was free to go outside and roam whenever I pleased. I had a wonderful, loving relationship with this woman and she treated me very well. One day, she told me that she was starting to get sick. Her health was starting to fail, and she knew that her days were numbered.

She put me in her car and drove 20 miles to another house. ""You will meet my granddaughter,"" she told me. ""She is very nice, and she will make sure you are taken care of.""

I got to go back with my elderly companion and she lived about another week. As she was dying, she told me to be a good girl and that she would always be looking after me.

This made me very sad because I loved the woman and we were like a family. She told me that she wanted to take care of one final thing before she died. She put me in her car and drove 20 miles to another house. ""You will meet my granddaughter,"" she told me. ""She is very nice, and she will make sure you are taken care of.""

I loved cats in my other lives, and I thought I could relate to them. he movie went on to show me that I had been a cat for many years and had lived a happy, complete life.

This made me very sad because I loved the woman and we were like a family. She told me that she wanted to take care of one final thing before she died. She put me in her car and drove 20 miles to another house. ""You will meet my granddaughter,"" she told me. ""She is very nice, and she will make sure you are taken care of.""

One day, she told me that she was starting to get sick. Her health was starting to fail, and she knew that her days were numbered. This made me very sad because I loved the woman and we were like a family. She told me that she wanted to take care of one final thing before she died. She put me in her car and drove 20 miles to another house. ""You will meet my granddaughter,"" she told me. ""She is very nice, and she will make sure you are taken care of.""

I got to go back with my elderly companion and she lived about another week. As she was dying, she told me to be a good girl and that she would always be looking after me.
