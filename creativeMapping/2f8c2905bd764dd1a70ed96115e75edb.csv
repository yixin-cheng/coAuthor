One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do.

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do.

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do.

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do. 
""I have to get you to a hospital"" she said.

The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path.

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do. 
""I have to get you to a hospital"" she said.
 ""I'll call for help"". She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911.

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do. 
I have to get you to a hospital"" she said.
 ""I'll call for help"". She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911.

The rest of the day was a blur. The man, Mike, was in the hospital, sleeping now. Janey felt good.  Focusing on other people besides herself

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".

One day, Janey was jogging on the path near her house. She had been trying to focus on other things since her breakup, and running had given her a new goal. The fresh air and exercise were good for her, as Mamma had said.  Her favorite trail was the mountain trail behind the house, that led to town. Bikers and hikers came there, good people, with great energy and friendly demeanors. There were many species of birds, and creeping raspberry bushes on either side of the path. 

Janey saw a man off to the right, on the side of the path. He had something in his hands. 
“Hey!”"" she called. ""Are you okay?"" The man turned to look at her, and as she approached, she could see blood on his shirt and hands. 
""I went off the path"" He croaked weakly, ""and stepped into a wolf trap"".   
Janey was horrified. Traps were cruel, illegal in the state, and most had been disposed of years ago. She had never seen one before, and was shocked at the size of it. The man was bleeding badly, and she didn't know what to do. 
I have to get you to a hospital"" she said.
 ""I'll call for help"". She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911.

The rest of the day was a blur. The man, Mike, was in the hospital, sleeping now. Janey felt good.  Focusing on other people besides herself
