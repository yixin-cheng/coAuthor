 ""I command you to fly away."" I cannot do that said the little bee, we need your help. But I am deathly allergic to you. You must fly off before my mother sees you. I cannot do that, said the little bee, we need your help. I can also assure you that you are not allergic to us. Even though I could not believe my eye and ears, I just had the feeling that this little bee was telling the truth. Okay, what do you need my help with? We need you to find the queen bee. She has been kidnapped by the evil Murder Hornets. We need you to find her and bring her back. Why me? Because you are our King and lead protector of the queen. The murder hornets have trapped your consciousness inside this human boy's body. 
This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true. I suggest you keep your human form for now as it will be an asset while rescuing the queen. We will be following you with and army of 500,000. The military leader told me that I will get into a suit, grab the center of the hornets hive and run off with it to safety while the warrior bees cause a distraction. 
The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious. We will now transfer your consiouness back into your old bee body. A",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The murder hornets have trapped your consciousness inside this human boy's body. 
This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true. I suggest you keep your human form for now as it will be an asset while rescuing the queen. We will be following you with and army of 500,000. The military leader told me that I will get into a suit, grab the center of the hornets hive and run off with it to safety while the warrior bees cause a distraction. 
The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious.

You look around, and see a tiny bee, no bigger than a thumb, wearing a tiny crown. ou're a little confused, but you decide to play along.
 ""I command you to fly away."" I cannot do that said the little bee, we need your help. But I am deathly allergic to you. You must fly off before my mother sees you.

The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious. We will now transfer your consiouness back into your old bee body. As I was undressing, I felt a little poke on the back of my elbow.

 ""I command you to fly away."" I cannot do that said the little bee, we need your help. But I am deathly allergic to you. You must fly off before my mother sees you. I cannot do that, said the little bee, we need your help. I can also assure you that you are not allergic to us. Even though I could not believe my eye and ears, I just had the feeling that this little bee was telling the truth. Okay, what do you need my help with? We need you to find the queen bee. She has been kidnapped by the evil Murder Hornets. We need you to find her and bring her back. Why me? Because you are our King and lead protector of the queen. The murder hornets have trapped your consciousness inside this human boy's body. 
This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true. I suggest you keep your human form for now as it will be an asset while rescuing the queen. We will be following you with and army of 500,000. The military leader told me that I will get into a suit, grab the center of the hornets hive and run off with it to safety while the warrior bees cause a distraction. 
The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious. We will now transfer your consiouness back into your old bee body. As I was undressing, I felt a little poke on the back of my elbow. The poke turned into a burning sensation and then a white hot flamming mess. I was stung by one of the bees.

You look around, and see a tiny bee, no bigger than a thumb, wearing a tiny crown. ou're a little confused, but you decide to play along.

The murder hornets have trapped your consciousness inside this human boy's body. 
This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true.

You look around, and see a tiny bee, no bigger than a thumb, wearing a tiny crown. ou're a little confused, but you decide to play along.
 ""I command you to fly away."" I cannot do that said the little bee, we need your help. But I am deathly allergic to you. You must fly off before my mother sees you.

She has been kidnapped by the evil Murder Hornets. We need you to find her and bring her back. Why me? Because you are our King and lead protector of the queen. The murder hornets have trapped your consciousness inside this human boy's body. 
This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true.

The military leader told me that I will get into a suit, grab the center of the hornets hive and run off with it to safety while the warrior bees cause a distraction. 
The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious.

This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true.

The military leader told me that I will get into a suit, grab the center of the hornets hive and run off with it to safety while the warrior bees cause a distraction. 
The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious.

The military leader told me that I will get into a suit, grab the center of the hornets hive and run off with it to safety while the warrior bees cause a distraction. 
The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious. We will now transfer your consiouness back into your old bee body. As I was undressing, I felt a little poke on the back of my elbow. The poke turned into a burning sensation and then a white hot flamming mess. I was stung by one of the bees. As I layed on the ground dying, I asked the leader why after all my help they would not return my to my bee body but kill me instead. He said that if the world knew there were several super intelligent insect species, we would be eradicated. Since you are the only one that knows we must snuff your out to retain our secret.

You look around, and see a tiny bee, no bigger than a thumb, wearing a tiny crown. ou're a little confused, but you decide to play along.
 ""I command you to fly away."" I cannot do that said the little bee, we need your help. But I am deathly allergic to you. You must fly off before my mother sees you. I cannot do that, said the little bee, we need your help. I can also assure you that you are not allergic to us.

She has been kidnapped by the evil Murder Hornets. We need you to find her and bring her back. Why me? Because you are our King and lead protector of the queen. The murder hornets have trapped your consciousness inside this human boy's body. 
This was getting crazier and crazier but the boy just felt like it was all the truth. He did not know how but he knew it to be true.

The plan worked. The queen was saved and I was fine thanks to my bee suit. Unfortunetly we lost more then half our soldiers but we have come out victorious.
