The alien is a bit confused by the fact that the humans are not sending a rescue mission, but are instead sending a single individual.
 This was not just any individual though, this was Dennis Rodman, the man who was able to soften the heart of North Korea's dictator. If humanity thought anyone would be able to get the alien to understand we needed our Hollywood star back, it would be him.

As Dennis arrived at the spot Matt Damon was originally kidnapped, he found something very strange. The alien had not only kidnapped Matt Damon, but also the rest of the crew from The Martian. It seemed that this alien wasn't just studying Earth's culture, it was searching Earth for a way to colonize Mars for it's own alien race. Humanity was lucky these aliens were considerate enough to not want to invade and share Earth, they were just looking for a way to somehow live on a brand new and empty planet!


Dennis Rodman was able to convince the alien to send all the humans back to Earth, and to give him a chance to convince them
