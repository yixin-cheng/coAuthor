Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late.

Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone.

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, w",user,41,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.

"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shak",user,44,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.
 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by hum",user,48,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature. Head back to the homeworld a",user,49,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature. Head back to the homeworld and get ready for permanent",user,49,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.

"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""Because I said so.

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

 All scans confirmed limited technology, less than 4 sun revolutions ago. I don't know where all this is coming from."" 

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.  
""Xztylus, I want you to go down there and get that Matt Damon thing.
"" The subordinate did not look pleased. ""Why? And why me?""
""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. ""Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.""

Charmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature.

As the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.

""What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!"" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.

Matt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. ""And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature. Head back to the homeworld and get ready for permanent desk duty.""

""Xztylus! I thought you said this was a primitive society! What is even happening?"" Ydjflk shouted at his subordinate.
""I thought it was a primitive society, sir.

Ydjflk looked at the screen, where Matt Damon was being held captive in a small cage, while a group of humans were trying to figure out how to get past the security measures. ""We are in deep space. How did they even get here. And why can't we seem to stop them?""

Xztylus looked at the screen, and then back at his superior. And then back at his screen again. ""Sir, I don't know how to answer that. But I suggest we do something quickly. Headquarters just denied our request for backup and support.""

""What! They specifically told us to come here and get this 'Matt Damon' thing and now they won't help? I knew there was some off about this mission. I knew it.""

Only 1 human month had passed since they scooped up ""Matt Damon"" from that noisy, smelly planet. And now they were in deep space, and their superiors were denying them support. There was only one option.

""Because I said so.
 And I have a plan. You will go down there and get the Matt Damon thing, and then you will bring it back to me.""

And maybe Ydjflk have a plan. But it was already too late. Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage.
