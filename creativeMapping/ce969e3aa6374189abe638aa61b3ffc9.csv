So, Mork didn't really realize that he'd feel so strongly about a human. His ship landed some time ago and when landing, he swore he'd never get so close he'd be hurt.

Mork felt he was a strong shape shifter, measuring his ability to blend as others had, thousands of years in the past here. The shifters had been among Earthlings a long time. Jill was supposed to be just another sort of way to fit in for a brief time. She was sort of usual, not at all unique. Mork didn't know what it was about her. 

Jill wasn't unique, a little too trusting maybe, but that worked to his advantage. He was able, a year ago, when first being broken off with her, to shift and adapt, his hallmark.  He made it a small goal to win her over again, She claimed, last year, that she needed some ""Space"", if only she knew what he knew about space, she'd have skipped this term.
