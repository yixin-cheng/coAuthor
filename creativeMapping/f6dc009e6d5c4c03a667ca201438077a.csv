""Was it all some sort of joke?!"" asked the Vice President.

THe President shook his head sadly. ""No, it was no joke."" He had just gotten off of the phone with the leader of the United Earth - it seemed that most of the nations of the world had joined the group - and learned the whole story. ""It was a desperate defense strategy.""
""Defense strategy?"" asked the Vice President.
 ""Against what?""

""Us. Or rather the US as it was back then. You're only 45 right? So you've only learned the cleaned up version  of our history and that war."" 
""Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?""


""Everything. The President back then was ruthless, self absorbed, and determined to put the US in control of the whole world. And our military was strong enough to do it. If it hadn't been for the other nations of the world uniting against us, we would have won. And even then, they were afraid of us recovering faster and trying again. So they came up with a plan to trick us into voluntarily isolating. There is a lot more, but that is the short version.""

""I don't know.,"" said the President. ""I just don't know.""

Fortunately the population of the US did know. They were not happy about being tricked into isolation, and they were not happy about the fact that the rest of the world had been working together for 50. But they had become very practical over the period of self isolation and they weren't going to give up, or do anything rash now. They were going to work together to get their country back on its feet and then they were going to start working on the rest of the world.

And so they did. With an emigration from the US to rival the immigration to the US of the old days. US citizens moved to every country that would have them. They brought their work ethic, their culture, and their determination. And slowly the regained the trust of the world. And eventually the US was invited to join the United Earth. 
The US accepted the invitation, and became a full member of the United Earth.

text-insert,"Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation.

""Was it all some sort of joke?!"" asked the Vice President.

THe President shook his head sadly. ""No, it was no joke."" He had just gotten off of the phone with the leader of the United Earth - it seemed that most of the nations of the world had joined the group - and learned the whole story. ""It was a desperate defense strategy.""
""Defense strategy?"" asked the Vice President.
 ""Against what?""

""Us. Or rather the US as it was back then. You're only 45 right? So you've only learned the cleaned up version  of our history and that war."" 
""Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?""


""Everything. The President back then was ruthless, self absorbed, and determined to put the US in control of the whole world. And our military was strong enough to do it. If it hadn't been for the other nations of the world uniting against us, we would have won. And even then, they were afraid of us recovering faster and trying again. So they came up with a plan to trick us into voluntarily isolating. There is a lot more, but that is the short version.""

""So what do we do now?"" asked the VP. 
""I don't know.,"" said the President. ""I just don't know.""

Fortunately the population of the US did know. They were not happy about being tricked into isolation, and they were not happy about the fact that the rest of the world had been working together for 50. But they had become very practical over the period of self isolation and they weren't going to give up, or do anything rash now. They were going to work together to get their country back on its feet and then they were going to start working on the rest of the world.

And so they did. With an emigration from the US to rival the immigration to the US of the old days. US citizens moved to every country that would have them. They brought their work ethic, their culture, and their determination. And slowly the regained the trust of the world. And eventually the US was invited to join the United Earth. 
The US accepted the invitation, and became a full member of the United Earth.
 And less than 50 years later, the first US territory citizen was elected President of the Earth.
And the rest, as they say, is history.
