All citizens under 26 have taken the drug and slowly all begin to lose their minds. They become increasingly more violent and dangerous. When the critical side effect was realized it was too late. Too many of the population have already taken the drug and inevitably become insane and murderous. When the government realizes that they cannot save hundreds of millions, tens of millions, they decide to order a military takeover. However as the military took over, the plan backfired. Those younger and able to fight the hordes of insane were locked down. The horde wiped out more and more of humanity and the military had no solution. The military surrendered the last intact human city and those still alive.

You were among the last who knew how to live normally, and among the last to remember how this was caused. Thinking back to a movie plot you vaguely remember, you had the idea of giving the horde another dose of the very drug that caused all this. Why would that work? Well it turns out, it had been done before, and an additional dose of the once miracle drug turned disaster would be fatal.
