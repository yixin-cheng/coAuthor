He didn't know what was going on, but suddenly his ""#1 Dad"" mug changed to show that he was actually now ranked #999. He wondered what kind of weird magic was this that kept changing his mug.

It turned out that all the #1 Dad mugs in the world were changing numbers repeatedly. The whole world was confused and perplexed.
Bob was determined to find out why the mugs were changing. He thought that if he figured out why, then he might be able to change it back.
