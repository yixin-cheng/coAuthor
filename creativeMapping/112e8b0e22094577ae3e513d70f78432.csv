In this story there was a dad named Bob and one day while he was drinking coffee, he noticed something extremely bizarre about his mug. He didn't know what was going on, but suddenly his ""#1 Dad"" mug changed to show that he was actually now ranked #999. He wondered what kind of weird magic was this that kept changing his mug. He went to talk to his friends about it and they started experiencing the same thing. He even saw a story about it when he watched the news that evening. It turned out that all the #1 Dad mugs in the world were changing numbers repeatedly. The whole world was confused and perplexed.
Bob was determined to find out why the mugs were changing. He thought that if he figured out why, then he might be able to change it back. So he and his friends started to dig up information and asked a lot of questions. Then one afternoon Bob had to save his toddler son when he ran out into traffic. After this happened the number on his mug went up to #20 from 999! He suddenly realized what it must mean. If he saved his son from getting hit by a car, then that was what gave him the boost. So it must mean that the number on the mug was his actual dad ranking! Bob couldn't wait to tell his other dad friends. fter this, Bob and his friends started to figure out ways to get a boost in their rankings.
