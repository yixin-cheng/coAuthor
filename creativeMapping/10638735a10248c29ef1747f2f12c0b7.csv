You watch your second marriage. You watch as you have children, and then watch as you lose them, whether to estrangement from the divorce, or untimely deaths, or just the ordinary process of them growing up and moving out to lead their own lives.  You watch as you get older, and begin to feel your mortality, and become increasingly weak and infirm.

You start to get more than a little bored, figuring that this will soon end in your death, and that you'll be in this same movie theater yet again. You concentrate, you try to reach yourself in the film, you try to send a message. 'Get popcorn' is what you're trying to convey.  You're hoping your film self will listen, and that the next time you have to go through this, at least you'll have something to munch on while watching this dreary movie again",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.  he film is about your life, and you are the star.
 As you watch the story unfold, you talk to the other people, your 'twins', and ask them what they think is going on here.  You all agree that you are in a cinema, and that you are watching a film about your lives. Having  found that discussion less than illuminating, you return your attention to the film.  You watch as you are born, and then grow up. Childhood is just as traumatic as you remember it being.  You watch as you meet your first love, and then receive your first heartbreak. You note that you made pretty much the same mistakes this time as you did in the past.

You watch as you finish high school, go to college, and get your first real job.   ou watch as you fall in love again, and get married.
 At this point, you begin to get a little nervous about where this story is going. You stand up and walk to the back of the theatre, looking for an usher, checking to see if maybe there's a concession stand out front.  You find a door marked 'EXIT', and you push it open.  You get a bad feeling about this, and decide to return to the theater for now, but you still have a craving for popcorn or even cheese nachos.  You return to your seat, and continue watching the film. You watch as your marriage falls apart from the same poor choices, and continue watching as you go through the same experiences again and again, and you begin to wonder if you are really making any progress.  You watch your second marriage. You watch as you have children, and then watch as you lose them, whether to estrangement from the divorce, or untimely deaths, or just the ordinary process of them growing up and moving out to lead their own lives.
