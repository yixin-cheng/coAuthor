Suddenly, there is a loud noise behind you in the theater. You turn around, and cannot believe your eyes. It is the old man from the movie, but he is being ushered down the aisle. Everyone cheers and applauds, and the screen goes blank. 

You are very confused. ""What just happened?"" You ask yourself. ""Where am I?""  
There is soft white light surrounding everything, and it hits you all at once. You are dead, and you are in Heaven.   

A tall woman approaches you. She is dressed in a long white robe, and her hair is long and flowing. 
""You have been given a rare chance"", she says. ""I have been instructed to give you a choice."" ""A choice?""
 You ask, bewildered. 
""You may return to Earth, to give advice to your next self, to improve them, and help you avoid pitfalls."" But, you will feel their pain, their anger, their failure in life, but none of the good. Will you do this?"" ""Yes"", you say, without hesitation.

 You ask, bewildered. 
""You may return to Earth, to give advice to your next self, to improve them, and help you avoid pitfalls."" But, you will feel their pain, their anger, their failure in life, but none of the good. Will you do this?"" ""Yes"", you say, without hesitation.
