The ""tribe"" as they were called stayed as far away from the alien civilization that took over the earth as they could they were searching for what the elders referred to as ""the source"" They were trying to find where the Mana was the strongest in order to try to harness it once again and use it to fight the alien menace.
o when one of the elders was called to a meeting by a shadowy figure, he couldn't say no.
 He met the apparition that came to him in a telepathic vision nearby to see why the spectre had visited him in his mind.  He found that the spectre was of course the alien leader. The leader cam to the elder with a deal. The aliens, too had been searching for the source. They wanted to form an alliance with the surviving tribes to piece together information in finding the location of the Mana source. The shadowy figure offered to help the elder's tribe in finding the source if they would help them in their fight against the remaining humans. The elder thought about this and wondered if maybe becoming partners with the aliens was the only way for the human race to survive, even if they helped try to eradicate the rest of the species. The elder decided he couldn't trust the aliens and tried to get away but the shadowed figure caught him and took him prisoner hoping another member of the tribe would accept the offer in order to save the elder. 

The elder's daughter Nia was a strong-willed, brave young woman. She learned of her father's capture and rallied the rest of the tribes together and formed alliances of her own with the leaders of the other tribes of remaining humans. The co-op of the tribes put together the information they had and after years of trying finally found the Mana source and used it against the Aliens to rescue her father. After the aliens were defeated, the elders of the remaining tribes made plans to form their own government where they would use the source for good. They offered the aliens a place on Earth if they promised to live in harmony with the humans and they said they would not agree to such an offer so Nia had no other option than to channel all of the Mana power she could muster to banish the aliens from Earth for good.

The ""tribe"" as they were called stayed as far away from the alien civilization that took over the earth as they could they were searching for what the elders referred to as ""the source"" They were trying to find where the Mana was the strongest in order to try to harness it once again and use it to fight the alien menace.
o when one of the elders was called to a meeting by a shadowy figure, he couldn't say no.
 He met the apparition that came to him in a telepathic vision nearby to see why the spectre had visited him in his mind.  He found that the spectre was of course the alien leader. The leader cam to the elder with a deal. The aliens, too had been searching for the source. They wanted to form an alliance with the surviving tribes to piece together information in finding the location of the Mana source. The shadowy figure offered to help the elder's tribe in finding the source if they would help them in their fight against the remaining humans. The elder thought about this and wondered if maybe becoming partners with the aliens was the only way for the human race to survive, even if they helped try to eradicate the rest of the species. The elder decided he couldn't trust the aliens and tried to get away but the shadowed figure caught him and took him prisoner hoping another member of the tribe would accept the offer in order to save the elder. 

The elder's daughter Nia was a strong-willed, brave young woman. She learned of her father's capture and rallied the rest of the tribes together and formed alliances of her own with the leaders of the other tribes of remaining humans. The co-op of the tribes put together the information they had and after years of trying finally found the Mana source and used it against the Aliens to rescue her father. After the aliens were defeated, the elders of the remaining tribes made plans to form their own government where they would use the source for good.

The ""tribe"" as they were called stayed as far away from the alien civilization that took over the earth as they could they were searching for what the elders referred to as ""the source"" They were trying to find where the Mana was the strongest in order to try to harness it once again and use it to fight the alien menace.
o when one of the elders was called to a meeting by a shadowy figure, he couldn't say no.
 He met the apparition that came to him in a telepathic vision nearby to see why the spectre had visited him in his mind.  He found that the spectre was of course the alien leader. The leader cam to the elder with a deal. The aliens, too had been searching for the source. They wanted to form an alliance with the surviving tribes to piece together information in finding the location of the Mana source. The shadowy figure offered to help the elder's tribe in finding the source if they would help them in their fight against the remaining humans. The elder thought about this and wondered if maybe becoming partners with the aliens was the only way for the human race to survive, even if they helped try to eradicate the rest of the species. The elder decided he couldn't trust the aliens and tried to get away but the shadowed figure caught him and took him prisoner hoping another member of the tribe would accept the offer in order to save the elder. 

The elder's daughter Nia was a strong-willed, brave young woman. She learned of her father's capture and rallied the rest of the tribes together and formed alliances of her own with the leaders of the other tribes of remaining humans.
