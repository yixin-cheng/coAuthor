Rick had sworn he would never talk to his mother about girl, but he needed some advice. 
Mom, I've been trying to get a girl to like me, but nothing seems to work.
"" ""Rick,  baby,you've been trying tto be someone else, o get a girl to like you for years.
 Why don't you just be yourself? Women like that.""
 He paused. He hadn't though about revealing his powers to Brittney-it could be dangerous. ""I don't think she'd believe me, Mom.""

""Honey, there's magic in these Appalachia hills that her grandma has told her about. Try telling her-be honest, and start by being friends. If she doesn't like you for you, there's plenty of other girls who will love my strong, handsome, hardworking boy."" 
Rick decided to follow his mother's advice.

Rick had sworn he would never talk to his mother about girls, but he needed some advice, and his father . 
Mom, I've been trying to get a girl to like me, but nothing seems to work.
"" ""Rick,  baby,you've been trying tto be someone else, o get a girl to like you for years.

 He paused. He hadn't though about revealing his powers to Brittney-it could be dangerous. ""I don't think she'd believe me, Mom.""

""Honey, there's magic in these Appalachia hills that her grandma has told her about. Try telling her-be honest, and start by being friends. If she doesn't like you for you, there's plenty of other girls who will love my strong, handsome, hardworking boy.""

As a shapeshifter, he had tried different ethnicities and body-types, but nothing seemed to ""click"" with her.   He had tried being a doctor, a lawyer, a mechanic, a teacher, a plumber, a carpenter, a construction worker, a musician. He had tried being a white guy, a black guy, an Asian guy, a Hispanic guy, an Indian guy, a Native American guy,  and everything in between. Rick was beginning to wonder what else he could change. 

Rick had sworn he would never talk to his mother about girls, but he needed some advice, and his father was long gone. 
Mom, I've been trying to get a girl to like me, but nothing seems to work.
"" ""Rick,  baby,you've been trying tto be someone else, o get a girl to like you for years.
 Why don't you just be yourself? Women like that.""
 He paused. He hadn't though about revealing his powers to Brittney-it could be dangerous. ""I don't think she'd believe me, Mom."" a

""Honey, there's magic in these Appalachia hills that her grandma has told her about. Try telling her-be honest, and start by being friends. If she doesn't like you for you, there's plenty of other girls who will love my strong, handsome, hardworking boy.""

Rick sighed. He had tried as hard as he could to impress Brittney, to befriend and talk with her, but nothing seemed to work. As a shapeshifter, he had tried different ethnicities and body-types, but nothing seemed to ""click"" with her.   Little did he know that her fine intuition had picked up on his deception.

Rick had tried everything. He had tried being a doctor, a lawyer, a mechanic, a teacher, a plumber, a carpenter, a construction worker, a musician. He had tried being a white guy, a black guy, an Asian guy, a Hispanic guy, an Indian guy, a Native American guy,  and everything in between. Rick was beginning to wonder what else he could change.

As a shapeshifter, he had tried different ethnicities and body-types, but nothing seemed to ""click"" with her.   Little did he know that her fine intuition had picked up on his deception. Though she couldn't place a finger on it, Brittney felt every guy she had dated in the last year had been lying to her. 

Rick had tried everything. He had tried being a doctor, a lawyer, a mechanic, a teacher, a plumber, a carpenter, a construction worker, a musician. He had tried being a white guy, a black guy, an Asian guy, a Hispanic guy, an Indian guy, a Native American guy,  and everything in between. Rick was beginning to wonder what else he could change.

"" ""Rick,  baby,you've been trying tto be someone else, o get a girl to like you for years.
 Why don't you just be yourself? Women like that.""
 He paused. He hadn't though about revealing his powers to Brittney-it could be dangerous. ""I don't think she'd believe me, Moama"" And my wolf-form is very raggedy and ugly

""Honey, there's magic in these Appalachia hills that her grandma has told her about. Try telling her-be honest, and start by being friends. If she doesn't like you for you, there's plenty of other girls who will love my strong, handsome, hardworking boy."" 
""Now go, be yourself, run in the woods, do what you love, and let her come to you!""

Mama chuckled as she hung up.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

Rick sighed. He had tried as hard as he could to impress Brittney, to befriend and talk with her, but nothing seemed to work. As a shapeshifter, he had tried different ethnicities and body-types, but nothing seemed to ""click"" with her.   Little did he know that her fine intuition had picked up on his deception. Though she couldn't place a finger on it, Brittney felt every guy she had dated in the last year had been lying to her. 

Rick had tried everything. He had tried being a doctor, a lawyer, a mechanic, a teacher, a plumber, a carpenter, a construction worker, a musician. He had tried being a white guy, a black guy, an Asian guy, a Hispanic guy, an Indian guy, a Native American guy,  and everything in between. Rick was beginning to wonder what else he could change. 

Rick had sworn he would never talk to his mother about girls, but he needed some advice, and his father was long gone.
