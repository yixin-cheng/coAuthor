text-insert,"Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. It resulted in us being entirely behind from a technological standpoint. Other countries are far more advanced and now we are a third world country. 

Everything is now outdated, including our military. Other countries now have self driving cars everywhere and have switched to more environmentally friendly energy. We are now seen as the country that mainly contributes to pollution and global warming. 

We also have outdated medical care. Other countries no longer have diseases or even things like the flu. They don't want us to visit them so a ban is in place. They are scared of us. 
We are now trying to catch up to the rest of the world.
 We're told that in order to trade or be allowed to travel worldwide that we'll have to become more advanced. The problem with that is that we're so far behind that we'll never catch up. 
The government has decided to make a deal with the devil.
 That's the only option to even have a chance in this new world. The devil will make our country as advanced as the rest of the world but it requires the souls of everyone in the United States. 
The government has decided that it's a good idea.
 As can be imagined, the citizens are very divided. Some are happy as they just care about the economic impact. Others are outraged. It creates a great divide in our country and a civil war breaks out as we as a country are literally fighting for our very souls. Is it even possible for the deal to be broken? No one knows but this war is about that very thing.
