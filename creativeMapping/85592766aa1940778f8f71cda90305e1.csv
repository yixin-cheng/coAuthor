The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time.

The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.

The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.

The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world.

 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant.

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant.

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

Riku was able to defeat his arch rival and also save the world. A beautiful first chapter to this series. However in the next book a more powerful and more evil for",user,39,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

Riku was able to defeat his arch rival and also save the world. A beautiful first chapter to this series. However in the next book a more powerful and more evil force will challenge Riku. Will Riku be up to the challenge or will evil triumph over good? For the sak",user,41,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant.

This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant.
