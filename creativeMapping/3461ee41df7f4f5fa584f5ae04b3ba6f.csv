He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

However, there are some who would seek to restore the lost source of magic, and have spent their lives scouring the planet for any information on how to do so. They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page.

 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully.

Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

However, there are some who would seek to restore the lost source of magic, and have spent their lives scouring the planet for any information on how to do so. They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enouc",user,23,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully.

He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully.

The world was plunged into an age of darkness, an age without Mana. Today, humans have been able to adapt to the harsh world without relying on magic, using instead alternative fuel sources to power the cities of the world.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone.",api,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say.

Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome.

He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic.

He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say.

Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic.

Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic.

That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

Today, humans have been able to adapt to the harsh world without relying on magic, using instead alternative fuel sources to power the cities of the world.

They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic.

They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good.

That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others.

Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic.

He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others.

 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Mag

Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant. Perhaps, Isaac thought,

They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant. Perhaps, Isaac thought, the next person that cam

That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good.

The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome.

Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant.

They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant.

That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant. Perhaps, Isaac thought, the next person that came across the tome would share it with the world, and Mana would once

Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic.

The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant. Perhaps, Isaac thought, the next person that came across the tome would share it with the world, and Mana would once again be c

They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant.

Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic.
