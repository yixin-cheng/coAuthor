""It mined itself. Its self-mining depleted uranium"" said the pig.
And the wolf was like, ""that is so cool!""

And the wolf was like, ""can I come in and see it?""


nd the pig was like, ""sure"" and he let the wolf in.


The wolf advanced toward the pig. ""I'd stop if I were you,"" said the pig, and reached for a nearby wand. Holding the wand near his belly a loud clicking filled the room.

 ""A Geiger counter"" said the pig. ""If you eat me you will get radiation sickness and die.""

nd the pig was like, ""sure"" and he let the wolf in.


The wolf advanced toward the pig. ""I'd stop if I were you,"" said the pig, and reached for a nearby wand. Holding the wand near his belly a loud clicking filled the room.

What’s that?"" asked the wolf.
 ""A Geiger counter"" said the pig. ""If you eat me you will get radiation sickness and die.""
""Oh"" said the wolf, ""that sucks, I was really looking forward to eating you.""


""I know you were"", said the pig, and hit the wolf over the head with the phony Geiger counter. The wolf collapsed.
And the pig was like, ""good riddance"".
 He then stuffed the wolf into the oven and set it on ""bake.""
When the wolf was fully cooked the pig ate him.
 

That is how the 92nd little pig got his groove back.
The end.

Now I’d like to tell you about the time that the 92nd little pig single-handedly won World War Two.

text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude, where did you get the uranium?"". And the 92nd little pig was like, ""I mined it out of the ground"". 

""How did you do that?"" 

""With a shovel"" said the pig.
And the wolf was like, ""that's pretty cool and all but I really meant ,how did you mine it from the ground?""


""It mined itself. It's self-mining depleted uranium"" said the pig.
And the wolf was like, ""that is so cool!""

And the wolf was like, ""can I come in and see it?""
