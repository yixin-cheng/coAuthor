Side effects include not being able to stop dancing and singing. Everything you do from shopping, working, trying to jog, even making a cup of coffee you did it all while singing and dancing. 

This wasn't the only side effect though. Another side effect was that you couldn't stop yourself from telling the truth. Oh my, did that really get a lot of dudes in trouble with their wives. ""Honey does this dress make me look fat?"" kind of trouble. Almost even worse was with their bosses who knew about this side effect... ""You think I am a good boss?"" kind of questions before they would lose their jobs. 

If that wasn't bad enough, there was yet another side effect. That side effect was that you couldn't stop yourself from being happy. Ever tried to go to a funeral looking all happy and jolly? I am sure it will not produce good results.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

Side effects include not being able to stop dancing and singing. Everything you do from shopping, working, trying to jog, even making a cup of coffee you did it all while singing and dancing.

""You think I am a good boss?"" kind of questions before they would lose their jobs.
