The US government had snapped into action, as they began to recognize these threats to their security. Over the 50 year period of isolation they had almost passed one bill, but the president was sick and didn't sign it and then it got lost. Due to this lack of legislation and the subsequent lapse in security, all government records were gone. The truth is, they never really wrote anything down.

A renaissance of new ideas and cultural sharing had created a world filled with truly happy people. 

The United States was in shambles. They had enough money and resources to live for 1000 years in isolation, when they went into isolation. By the time the 50 years of isolation elapsed, much of the country was on fire and people were robbing each other with military style weapons for things that they didn't really need. The lack of competition with other nations had left the US with an identity problem. They solved this by taking on a new identity, as the most violent people in recorded history.
