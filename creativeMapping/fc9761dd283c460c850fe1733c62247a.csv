WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.

WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

""I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations."" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

She is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that."" she says in a strained voice.

But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

You look at the man, and he smiles at you.

She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

""I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations."" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

She is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that."" she says in a strained voice.

But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.

""I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations."" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

She is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that."" she says in a strained voice. WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

You are too shocked to do anything but what she tells you. The next thing you know you are flying down the highway and she is telling you a wild story of espionage, genetic engineering, government control, and secret societies. And somehow it all revolves around a bee cult from thousands of years ago.""

She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.

""I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations."" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

She is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that."" she says in a strained voice. WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town.

You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

You are too shocked to do anything but what she tells you. The next thing you know you are flying down the highway and she is telling you a wild story of espionage, genetic engineering, government control, and secret societies. And somehow it all revolves around a bee cult from thousands of years ago.""

""I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations."" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

She is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that."" she says in a strained voice.

You look at the man, and he smiles at you.

 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.

""I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations."" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

She is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that."" she says in a strained voice.

She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.

WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

You are too shocked to do anything but what she tells you.

WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. ""Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.""
You look at the man, and he smiles at you.
 In the worst possible way.  ""Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.""

You feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. 
""Mom, what was that all about?"" you ask.
 As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. ""Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me ""You Majesty"". What does that mean? How is it even possible?""
She looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye.
 ""Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.""

You are too shocked to do anything but what she tells you. The next thing you know you are flying down the highway and she is telling you a wild story of espionage, genetic engineering, government control, and secret societies. And somehow it all revolves around a bee cult from thousands of years ago.""
