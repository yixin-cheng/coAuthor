So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""Another little pig who I can try to eat!"" The wolf didn't know that the house was made of depleted uranium. This was because the little pig had a rare mutation that allowed her to live there without a hazmat suit. 
So the wolf went up to the house and knocked on the door.
 The little pig knew it was the wolf, and called out, ""Please wait there, right beside the house. I am busy."" So the wolf sat on a bench made from the wall of the house and relaxed. 
The little pig went to the kitchen and made a sandwich.
 Then she sat down and ate the sandwich while watching television. The wolf fell asleep on the bench made of depleted uranium. Hours later, he woke up and yelled through the window, ""Hey there, little pig, are you still busy?"" The little pig said, ""Come on in, you can wait inside."" She unlocked the door and ran to an inner room and bolted and locked the door and went to sleep. 
The wolf opened the door and walked into the house.
 He looked around, but the little pig wasn't anywhere he could see. So he went to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich with the supplies the little pig had used earlier. Then he sat on the couch and read a newspaper.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""Another little pig who I can try to eat!"" The wolf didn't know that the house was made of depleted uranium. This was because the little pig had a rare mutation that allowed her to live there without a hazmat suit. 
So the wolf went up to the house and knocked on the door.
 The little pig knew it was the wolf, and called out, ""Please wait there, right beside the house. I am busy."" So the wolf sat on a bench made from the wall of the house and relaxed. 
The little pig went to the kitchen and made a sandwich.
 Then she sat down and ate the sandwich while watching television. The wolf fell asleep on the bench made of depleted uranium. Hours later, he woke up and yelled through the window, ""Hey there, little pig, are you still busy?"" The little pig said, ""Come on in, you can wait inside."" She unlocked the door and ran to an inner room and bolted and locked the door and went to sleep. 
The wolf opened the door and walked into the house.
 He looked around, but the little pig wasn't anywhere he could see. So he went to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich with the supplies the little pig had used earlier. Then he sat on the couch and read a newspaper. The wolf fell asleep on the couch. 

When he woke up, he felt a little sick. So he went back to sleep. When he woke up again, he felt very sick. He went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. He was turning green. He was also much smaller. He was turning into a frog. He said, ""Ribbit.""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""Another little pig who I can try to eat!"" The wolf didn't know that the house was made of depleted uranium. This was because the little pig had a rare mutation that allowed her to live there without a hazmat suit. 
So the wolf went up to the house and knocked on the door.
 The little pig knew it was the wolf, and called out, ""Please wait there, right beside the house. I am busy."" So the wolf sat on a bench made from the wall of the house and relaxed. 
The little pig went to the kitchen and made a sandwich.
 Then she sat down and ate the sandwich while watching television. The wolf fell asleep on the bench made of depleted uranium. Hours later, he woke up and yelled through the window, ""Hey there, little pig, are you still busy?"" The little pig said, ""Come on in, you can wait inside."" She unlocked the door and ran to an inner room and bolted and locked the door and went to sleep. 
The wolf opened the door and walked into the house.
 He looked around, but the little pig wasn't anywhere he could see. So he went to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich with the supplies the little pig had used earlier. Then he sat on the couch and read a newspaper. The wolf fell asleep on the couch. 

When he woke up, he felt a little sick. So he went back to sleep. When he woke up again, he felt very sick. He went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. He was turning green. He was also much smaller. He was turning into a frog. He said, ""Ribbit.""

text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""Another little pig who I can try to eat!"" The wolf didn't know that the house was made of depleted uranium. This was because the little pig had a rare mutation that allowed her to live there without a hazmat suit. 
So the wolf went up to the house and knocked on the door.
 The little pig knew it was the wolf, and called out, ""Please wait there, right beside the house. I am busy."" So the wolf sat on a bench made from the wall of the house and relaxed. 
The little pig went to the kitchen and made a sandwich.
 Then she sat down and ate the sandwich while watching television. The wolf fell asleep on the bench made of depleted uranium. Hours later, he woke up and yelled through the window, ""Hey there, little pig, are you still busy?"" The little pig said, ""Come on in, you can wait inside."" She unlocked the door and ran to an inner room and bolted and locked the door and went to sleep. 
The wolf opened the door and walked into the house.
 He looked around, but the little pig wasn't anywhere he could see. So he went to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich with the supplies the little pig had used earlier. Then he sat on the couch and read a newspaper. The wolf fell asleep on the couch. 

When he woke up, he felt a little sick. So he went back to sleep. When he woke up again, he felt very sick. He went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. He was turning green. He was also much smaller. He was turning into a frog. He said, ""Ribbit."" 

When the little pig heard this, she knew it was safe. She opened the door and said, ""Oh, you're a frog now. Let me get the door for you so you can go to the water."" She opened the door and the frog hopped out. And this was how the 92nd little pig made sure she would be safe f",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
