Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately.

Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. ",user,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away.

He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately.

Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful.

She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away.

He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately.

Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful.

She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away.

He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately.

Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy.

She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious.

She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life.

She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeure",user,42,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away.

She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew.""

But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious.

The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away.

Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life.

Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again. This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father. He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy.",user,45,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again. This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father. He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. No, he was going to be the father that Soeurette's daughter deserved.

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again. This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father. He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. No, he was going to be the father that Soeurette's daughter deserved.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust.

Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again. This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father. He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. No, he was going to be the father that Soeurette's daughter deserved.

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her.

She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again. This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father. He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. No, he was going to be the father that Soeurette's daughter deserved. And he kept this promise. Finally, Soeurette had truly found the one, but little did she know, she had found ""the o",user,48,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her.
