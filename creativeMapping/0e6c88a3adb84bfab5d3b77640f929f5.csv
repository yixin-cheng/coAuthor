Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana.

The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked.

Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors.

The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens.

The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease.

The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked.

 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease.

Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors.

 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease.

 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders.

The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked.

It took a lot of scientists and people with old wisdom to unlock this hidden power and the secrets behind it. They figured out that while yes, the mana is spread very thinly, if people work together they can channel their mana power together, creating an amount large enough to allow someone to wield it and its incredible power. 
The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.

They figured out that while yes, the mana is spread very thinly, if people work together they can channel their mana power together, creating an amount large enough to allow someone to wield it and its incredible power. 
The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.

They figured out that while yes, the mana is spread very thinly, if people work together they can channel their mana power together, creating an amount large enough to allow someone to wield it and its incredible power. 
The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.

The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.

It took a lot of scientists and people with old wisdom to unlock this hidden power and the secrets behind it. They figured out that while yes, the mana is spread very thinly, if people work together they can channel their mana power together, creating an amount large enough to allow someone to wield it and its incredible power. 
The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.

 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens.

 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed.

Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana.

 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told.

The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked.

The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed.
