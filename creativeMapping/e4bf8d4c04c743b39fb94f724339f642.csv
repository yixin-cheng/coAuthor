The pig smirked from the safety of his shell (and breath) proof housing. ""I'm not going to help you.  Just go in the bushes like the rest of your kind do.""  The wolf sighed. ""Fine."" Then he skulked off to the forest.

That settled, the pig sat down to enjoy his new home. He was just about to turn on the TV when he heard a knock at the door. It was, of course, the wolf again. ""What do you want?"" snapped the pig. ""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf paused, winced, and caught his breath. ""Isn't that overkill?""  he 92nd little pig said, ""I don't think so.""
 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

The pig smirked from the safety of his shell (and breath) proof housing. ""I'm not going to help you.  Just go in the bushes like the rest of your kind do.""  The wolf sighed. ""Fine."" Then he skulked off to the forest.

That settled, the pig sat down to enjoy his new home. He was just about to turn on the TV when he heard a knock at the door. It was, of course, the wolf again. ""What do you want?"" snapped the pig. ""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""

 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

The pig smirked from the safety of his shell (and breath) proof housing. ""I'm not going to help you.  Just go in the bushes like the rest of your kind do.""  The wolf sighed. ""Fine."" Then he skulked off to the forest.

That settled, the pig sat down to enjoy his new home. He was just about to turn on the TV when he heard a knock at the door. It was, of course, the wolf again. ""What do you want?"" snapped the pig. ""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf paused, winced, and caught his breath. ""Isn't that overkill?""  he 92nd little pig said, ""I don't think so.""
 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

The pig smirked from the safety of his shell (and breath) proof housing. ""I'm not going to help you.  Just go in the bushes like the rest of your kind do.""  The wolf sighed. ""Fine."" Then he skulked off to the forest.

That settled, the pig sat down to enjoy his new home. He was just about to turn on the TV when he heard a knock at the door. It was, of course, the wolf again. ""What do you want?"" snapped the pig. ""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf paused, winced, and caught his breath. ""Isn't that overkill?""  he 92nd little pig said, ""I don't think so.""
 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

The pig smirked from the safety of his shell (and breath) proof housing. ""I'm not going to help you.  Just go in the bushes like the rest of your kind do.""  The wolf sighed. ""Fine."" Then he skulked off to the forest.

That settled, the pig sat down to enjoy his new home. He was just about to turn on the TV when he heard a knock at the door. It was, of course, the wolf again. ""What do you want?"" snapped the pig. ""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""

 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

The pig smirked from the safety of his shell (and breath) proof housing. ""I'm not going to help you.  Just go in the bushes like the rest of your kind do.""  The wolf sighed. ""Fine."" Then he skulked off to the forest.

""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for gen",user,43,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf paused, winced, and caught his breath. ""Isn't that overkill?""  he 92nd little pig said, ""I don't think so.""

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for generations, when we could have been perfectly happy eating defenseless creatures out there.""

 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for generations, when we could have been perfectly happy eating defenseless creatures out there.""

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for generations, when we could have been perfectly happy eating defenseless creatures out there.""

 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

""I'm just here to say thank you."" said the wolf. ""Thanks for what?"" scoffed the pig. ""Thanks for not helping me."" said the wolf.

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for generations, when we could have been perfectly happy eating defenseless creatures out there.""

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for generations, when we could have been perfectly happy eating defenseless creatures out there.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf paused, winced, and caught his breath. ""Isn't that overkill?""  he 92nd little pig said, ""I don't think so.""
 ""You've been through brick, stone, duralloy, and the 85th little pig's steel reinforced concrete house, but you're still coming."" ""I'm not coming for you."" said the wolf. ""I've got to go to the bathroom. Could you maybe help a poor wolf out?""

""Why would you thank me for NOT helping you?"" asked the pig,  with more than a trace of skepticism. ""Because I was able to go to the bathroom in the bushes, and I didn't have to go in your house. I also wanted to thank you for something else.""

""What is it now?"" asked the pig, his beady little eyes rolling. ""I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to think outside the box. You see, I was so busy trying to get into your house that I didn't see the forest.""

The wolf continued. ""Plenty of stuff to eat out there, as it turns out, and it's not walled up behind depleted uranium.""
The wolf continued speaking as the pig considered this. ""As it turns out, me and my family have been wasting our lives, chasing after you for generations, when we could have been perfectly happy eating defenseless creatures out there.""
