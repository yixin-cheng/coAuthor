One day, the mother pig was out foraging in the woods when she found a large patch of mysterious wild strawberries. Strawberries were part of the diet of the pigs but these berries were threatened with extinction when the pig population began to multiply unchecked. The mother pig knew, however, that the strawberries could not support her one hundred children, and their offspring as well. 

The mysterious field of wild strawberries had a secret as well. This particular type of strawberry was a type of symbiotic organism. It acted as a sort of micro-ecosystem that actually housed many other creatures. As the pigs ate from these strawberries, they also ate the symbiotic creatures who lived there. This caused the pigs to develop a taste for other things, including blood.
