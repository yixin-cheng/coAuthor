 It turns out that the asteroids that were supposed to hit the Earth actually missed it. All of the emergency planning and preparedness was done for nothing. People have years worth of food and supplies stored away that can now be used or given away. People are celebrating this new time in their lives.  They are sharing their resources and having fun. 
ASudde ly anunknown, mysterious illness has been appearing.
 No one is certain where it is coming from. When people get sick, they don’t live long. One theory is that the illness is from the water supply. Others think it’s from the food supply. The only people that are not getting sick are children and anyone under the age of 18. At a government meeting, the adults realize that they are now dying out. The future will be in the hands of the children. 
The children decide to do things differently from their parents.
 They will make a new set of rules. No one will be allowed to have more than they need. Everyone will have a nice house. Everyone will have fun. Everyone will have clean water to drink. It's simple. It's fair. They called it Utopia. 
The children do as they said they would.
 For a time, Utopia was the greatest place on earth. Everyone always had everything they needed. Now the oldest children were growing up and becoming adults. They were getting grouchy and not wanting to have fun anymore. They stopped following the rules of Utopia. Some of them started to eat all the food themselves and didn't share it with anyone. They wanted to make rules about who can have clean water. Who can have nice houses. The kids of Utopia decided enough was enough. They went to war against the adults. The war did not last long, because the kids realized they were against war. They did not fight. The adults ended up fighting themselves and dying out by the end of the year. And the kids reigned on.",user,40,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
