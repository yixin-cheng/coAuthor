So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""  The pig responded, ""It is perfectly safe.  Not only that it is very sturdy.  You won't be able to blow this house down.""  The wolf responded, ""Dude you're contaminated!  I have no interest in blowing down  your house.""  Though never explicitly stated due to the delicate sensibilities of the intended audience,  the purpose of blowing down the house was to secure the pig so it could be eaten. This is because wolves eat pigs.

The wolf went on ""There are a number of studies that say depleted uranium is dangerous.  You've got this house just giving off radiation to whoever is within range.""  At that point, he reached into the messenger bag he carried and pulled out a condemnation notice which he proceeded to affix to the front door.  ""You've got 24 hours to vacate,"" the wolf said.

The pig inspected the notice. It was from the EPA.  It stated that his house was to be buried as it stood.  He gave a deep sigh.  Disheartened he began to gather his belonging.  Then he realized, the EPA would insist that his belongings also be interred so he desisted.

The wolf went on ""There are a number of studies that say depleted uranium is dangerous.  You've got this house just giving off radiation to whoever is within range.""  At that point, he reached into the messenger bag he carried and pulled out a condemnation notice which he proceeded to affix to the front door.  ""You've got 24 hours to vacate,"" the wolf said.

The pig inspected the notice. It was from the EPA.  It stated that his house was to be buried as it stood.  He gave a deep sigh.  Disheartened he began to gather his belonging.  Then he realized, the EPA would insist that his belongings also be interred so he desisted.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""  The pig responded, ""It is perfectly safe.  Not only that it is very sturdy.  You won't be able to blow this house down.""  The wolf responded, ""Dude you're contaminated!  I have no interest in blowing down  your house.""  Though never explicitly stated due to the delicate sensibilities of the intended audience,  the purpose of blowing down the house was to secure the pig so it could be eaten. This is because wolves eat pigs.

The wolf went on ""There are a number of studies that say depleted uranium is dangerous.  You've got this house just giving off radiation to whoever is within range.""  At that point, he reached into the messenger bag he carried and pulled out a condemnation notice which he proceeded to affix to the front door.  ""You've got 24 hours to vacate,"" the wolf said.

The pig inspected the notice. It was from the EPA.  It stated that his house was to be buried as it stood.  He gave a deep sigh.  Disheartened he began to gather his belonging.  Then he realized, the EPA would insist that his belongings also be interred so he desisted.
