""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks. 
""It's not about helping her,"" I say, ""It's about punishing her.

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well.

 ""You'll be there all semester. It is done. The car will be here in the morning."" I say, and I leave the house and slam the door.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks. 
""It's not about helping her,"" I say, ""It's about punishing her.

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks.

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks.

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks. 
""It's not about helping her,"" I say, ""It's about punishing her.

""You're going,"" I say.

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well. 
""You're going,"" I say to her.
 ""You'll be there all semester. It is done. The car will be here in the morning."" I say, and I leave the house and slam the door.

That night, I hear a rustling noise in my bedroom. I wake up to see my daughter with a shotgun pointed at my head. 
""I'm not going,"" she says.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks. 
""It's not about helping her,"" I say, ""It's about punishing her.

""You're going,"" I say.
 ""You're going and you're not coming back until you learn some respect.""

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well. 
""You're going,"" I say to her.
 ""You'll be there all semester. It is done. The car will be here in the morning."" I say, and I leave the house and slam the door.

That night, I hear a rustling noise in my bedroom. I wake up to see my daughter with a shotgun pointed at my head. 
""I'm not going,"" she says.

""You are,"" I say.

""I'm not,"" she says. as she cocks the barrel. 
I grab the barrel and push it away from my face.
 I grab the gun and throw it across the room. I grab my daughter by the throat and throw her against the wall.

I grab the barrel and push it away from my face.
 I grab the gun and throw it across the room. I grab my daughter by the throat and throw her against the wall.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

I grab the barrel and push it away from my face.
 I grab the gun and throw it across the room. I grab my daughter by the throat and throw her against the wall.

""You're going to boarding school,"" I say angrily. My wife yells at me and tells me that's not acceptable.   She tells me that our daughter is a good kid and that she doesn't deserve to be punished.

""She's a brat!"" I yell loudly. ""She's a spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate what she has!""

""Well, how is boarding school going to help that?"" My wife, Isobel, asks. 
""It's not about helping her,"" I say, ""It's about punishing her.
""
""I'm not going to boarding school,"" McKenzie says.
 
""You're going,"" I say.
 ""You're going and you're not coming back until you learn some respect.""

My wife starts crying and screaming at me some more. I don't care though. I call the boarding school and make the necessary arrangements. I grab all of my daughter's clothes and throw them into a duffel bag. I grab her toothbrush and her hairbrush and throw those in there as well. 
""You're going,"" I say to her.
 ""You'll be there all semester. It is done. The car will be here in the morning."" I say, and I leave the house and slam the door.

That night, I hear a rustling noise in my bedroom. I wake up to see my daughter with a shotgun pointed at my head. 
""I'm not going,"" she says.

""You are,"" I say.

""I'm not,"" she says. as she cocks the barrel. 
I grab the barrel and push it away from my face.
 I grab the gun and throw it across the room. I grab my daughter by the throat and throw her against the wall. 

""Stop it!"" Isobel yells. She points the gun at me. ""I'll do it!"" she yells.
""You're not going to shoot me,"" I say.
 ""You're not going to shoot me because you love me."" 
""I don't love you,"" she says.
 She shoots me in the chest and grabs the mug from the kitchen and smashes it over my head. ""You're the worst dad ever!"" She yells as I ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I shut my eyes tightly and rebound them open again several times. The mug says the same thing. It says #4,125,329. ""Is this some sort of prank?"" I ask my daughter, McKenzie.


""No, Dad,"" she says, ""It's just the way it is.
 You aren't the greatest, you aren't the worst, but you certainly are below average.""
