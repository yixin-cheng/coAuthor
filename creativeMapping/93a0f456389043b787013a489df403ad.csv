The world is now a place where war is legal once again, and the US is the only country that has not been involved in any conflict for 50 years. The United States has basically turned into Switzerland, a neutral country that won't get involved in conflicts they don't need to be involved in.

The United States economy is thriving because of this. GDP is high, unemployment is low and morale in general is sky high. The United States has become the envy of the world. They have an economy that is booming, phenomenal foreign policy and even universal healthcare.

Now you may be asking yourself why other countries can't become this neutral power. The answer is simple, other countries don't have the resources that the United States have. Some countries simply have to fight with others simply to survive. They need the medicine, the resources and the land that other countries inhabit. 

The United States also has another advantage over these other countries. The United States is known worldwide as the only true superpower left.

1436,text-insert,"Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. 

The world is now a place where war is legal once again, and the US is the only country that has not been involved in any conflict for 50 years. The United States has basically turned into Switzerland, a neutral country that won't get involved in conflicts they don't need to be involved in.

The United States economy is thriving because of this. GDP is high, unemployment is low and morale in general is sky high. The United States has become the envy of the world. They have an economy that is booming, phenomenal foreign policy and even universal healthcare.

Now you may be asking yourself why other countries can't become this neutral power. The answer is simple, other countries don't have the resources that the United States have. Some countries simply have to fight with others simply to survive. They need the medicine, the resources and the land that other countries inhabit. 

The United States also has another advantage over these other countries. The United States is known worldwide as the only true superpower left. No other country is going to want to get into a conflict where they are most likely going to lose. Other countries don't have the power, weapons or technology to overtake the United States. 

Now the United States could be a bully and try and take advantage of their advantageous position in the world.
