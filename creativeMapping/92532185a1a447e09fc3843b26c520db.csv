The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair because uranium can't be blown down. The pig had studied on the internet and done a ton of research after seeing all the other pigs in the community have their houses blown down by the wolf. 

That would caused the entire home to collapse. 

It was difficult to obtain uranium but luckily for the pig, he was able to find some on Amazon. He also had a ton of experience building homes. The wolf went back to his house and tried to do some research of his own. He had to figure out what could destroy uranium. 

The internet is an amazing place because the wolf was able to figure out that water destroys uranium. The wolf just had to figure out how to get enough water to the pigs home. He did some thinking and went back online. He did research and figured the best way to do this is to rent a water truck. A water truck is a big truck that has a hose similar to a firetruck. The wolf planned to drive the water truck to the pigs home and spray the home with water.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair because uranium can't be blown down.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair because uranium can't be blown down. The pig had studied on the internet and done a ton of research after seeing all the other pigs in the community have their houses blown down by the wolf. 

That would caused the entire home to collapse. 

It was difficult to obtain uranium but luckily for the pig, he was able to find some on Amazon. He also had a ton of experience building homes. The wolf went back to his house and tried to do some research of his own. He had to figure out what could destroy uranium. 

The internet is an amazing place because the wolf was able to figure out that water destroys uranium. The wolf just had to figure out how to get enough water to the pigs home. He did some thinking and went back online. He did research and figured the best way to do this is to rent a water truck. A water truck is a big truck that has a hose similar to a firetruck. The wolf planned to drive the water truck to the pigs home and spray the home with water. 

The wolf drove to the pigs home and got out of the water truck. He turned the hose and sprayed the home and to his dismay, the house didn't collapse like the internet said it would.  The pig came out of his house and was laughing at the wolf. He explained to him that the house wasn't actually made of depleted uranium. He would never tell the wolf the material of the home because he knew the wolf would go straight to the internet to find out how to ruin his house.

The pig tells the wolf to leave him and his house alone. The wolf gets extremely mad at this and tells the pig that he will figure out the material and will destroy the house before this is all done with. The wolf goes back home to research but for now the pig has finally gotten one over on the wolf",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
