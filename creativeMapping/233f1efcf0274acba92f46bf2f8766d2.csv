The next day, you are walking through the woods, and you see a bee.
 You are about to swat it, but it says ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You freeze. It's the same bee from before. It's not a dream. It's real.  ""Um, can you hear me?"" You say. ""Yes, Your Majesty. You are hive-attuned, one of the last queens. I've come here to beg you to lead us"", she says, as she bows deeply on your shoulder. ""Lead you to what?"" I wonder out loud.

The next day, you are walking through the woods, and you see a bee.
 You are about to swat it, but it says ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You freeze. It's the same bee from before. It's not a dream. It's real.  

""Um, can you hear me?"" You say. ""Yes, Your Majesty. You are hive-attuned, one of the last queens. I've come here to beg you to lead us"", she says, as she bows deeply on your shoulder.

You dream about the bee telling you that you are the queen of the bees, and that you must lead them to victory over the humans.  You dream of transforming into a bee, and stinging all the humans you have ever know. You wake up in a cold sweat, b you are still you. What a crazy nightmare. 
The next day, you are walking through the woods, and you see a bee.
 You are about to swat it, but it says ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You freeze. It's the same bee from before. It's not a dream. It's real.  

""Um, can you hear me?"" You say. ""Yes, Your Majesty. You are hive-attuned, one of the last queens. I've come here to beg you to lead us"", she says, as she bows deeply on your shoulder. ""Lead you to what?"" I wonder out loud. ""To victory over the humans, Your Majesty. The honeyed clans cannot rule until every last human is disposed of"" ""But I am a human"", you say. ""You are the queen of the bees, Your Majesty. You must lead us to victory."" 

Great. Now you're with a bee who is convinced that you're a bee yourself, and wants you to overthrow the humans. This is not what you had in mind for your day!",user,21,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

You stand perfectly still. There is a bee on you. You don't even dare look at it. A thousand thoughts race through your mind. 
Maybe it has stung you without you noticing, and you are dying. Maybe the poison from the stinger is making you delusional. Maybe you are imagining the whole thing. 
You can't take it anymore.
 You swat at the bee, and it flies away. You breathe a sigh of relief. You're fine.
You go about your day, but you can't get the bee out of your head.
 It was so real. You go to bed that night, and you dream about the bee.
