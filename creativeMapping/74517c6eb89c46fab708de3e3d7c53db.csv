Creating new life seems simple enough; cloning, or using egg and sperm still stored in banks, to make young humans. But there's a catch: infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating, and power, and other facilities needed to keep the elderly alive, so just living is becoming a struggle. The ""Lost Generations"" must marshal the increasingly elderly experts among them to not only begin the cloning/in vitro fertilization program, but try to maintain the failing power grid, and secure clean water, and edible food, and medicine for the sick among them.

The ""Lost Generations"" manage to eke out a precarious existence in the ruins, while their scientists scramble to create the first young humans. The efforts succeed, but the caretakers are getting older, and the new generation is still very young. The elderly hang on and desperately try to teach the children, and keep them safe and secure until they are old enough to fend for themselves. The success is by a narrow margin, but finally the new generation has reached young adulthood, just as the last of the caretakers are dying.

Creating new life seems simple enough; cloning, or using egg and sperm still stored in banks, to make young humans. But there's a catch: infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating, and power, and other facilities needed to keep the elderly alive, so just living is becoming a struggle. The ""Lost Generations"" must marshal the increasingly elderly experts among them to not only begin the cloning/in vitro fertilization program, but try to maintain the failing power grid, and secure clean water, and edible food, and medicine for the sick among them.

The ""Lost Generations"" manage to eke out a precarious existence in the ruins, while their scientists scramble to create the first young humans. The efforts succeed, but the caretakers are getting older, and the new generation is still very young. The elderly hang on and desperately try to teach the children, and keep them safe and secure until they are old enough to fend for themselves. The success is by a narrow margin, but finally the new generation has reached young adulthood, just as the last of the caretakers are dying.

Creating new life seems simple enough; cloning, or using egg and sperm still stored in banks, to make young humans. But there's a catch: infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating, and power, and other facilities needed to keep the elderly alive, so just living is becoming a struggle. The ""Lost Generations"" must marshal the increasingly elderly experts among them to not only begin the cloning/in vitro fertilization program, but try to maintain the failing power grid, and secure clean water, and edible food, and medicine for the sick among them.

The ""Lost Generations"" manage to eke out a precarious existence in the ruins, while their scientists scramble to create the first young humans. The efforts succeed, but the caretakers are getting older, and the new generation is still very young. The elderly hang on and desperately try to teach the children, and keep them safe and secure until they are old enough to fend for themselves. The success is by a narrow margin, but finally the new generation has reached young adulthood, just as the last of the caretakers are dying.

The efforts succeed, but the caretakers are getting older, and the new generation is still very young.

Creating new life seems simple enough; cloning, or using egg and sperm still stored in banks, to make young humans. But there's a catch: infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating, and power, and other facilities needed to keep the elderly alive, so just living is becoming a struggle. The ""Lost Generations"" must marshal the increasingly elderly experts among them to not only begin the cloning/in vitro fertilization program, but try to maintain the failing power grid, and secure clean water, and edible food, and medicine for the sick among them.

The ""Lost Generations"" manage to eke out a precarious existence in the ruins, while their scientists scramble to create the first young humans. The efforts succeed, but the caretakers are getting older, and the new generation is still very young. The elderly hang on and desperately try to teach the children, and keep them safe and secure until they are old enough to fend for themselves. The success is by a narrow margin, but finally the new generation has reached young adulthood, just as the last of the caretakers are dying.

At the incredible age of 101, you lie in a hospital bed, dying, surrounded by the young who have received medical training. You know you will soon slip into the afterlife, but you are content, because you know that thechildren will be safe, and will be able to carry on the human race.",user,14,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The drug has caused the people it was given to to develop a long-delayed, fatal, incidence, and within a week, every human on the planet other than the ""Lost Generations"" has died. This leaves the future of humanity in the hands of a small, aging group of people, who are now mostly in their 90s,  and are increasingly infirm.
