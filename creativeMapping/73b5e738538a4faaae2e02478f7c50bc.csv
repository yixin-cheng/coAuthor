""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay. "" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.

""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay. "" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  The wasps set up their nest across from ours. It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.

What it did have, however, was a lot of orders.  The main order was to find the majesty.   Which I guess is me?

""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay.

""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.

What it did have, however, was a lot of orders.  The main order was to find the majesty.   Which I guess is me?

""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay. "" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  The wasps set up their nest across from ours. It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.  


WIwill! help!, I said.
  ""Send a message to your hive to evacuate for tonight.  You can come back in the morning"".  ""Yes, your majesty"", the bee said.  I had a friend who happened to be an exterminator.  He dealt with wasps and other bugs.  I asked if I could borrow his suit and bug spray.  He was a little apprehensive, but he agreed.  I went to my father house and suited up.  

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

"" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  The wasps set up their nest across from ours. It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.  


WIwill! help!, I said.
  ""Send a message to your hive to evacuate for tonight.  You can come back in the morning"".  ""Yes, your majesty"", the bee said.  I had a friend who happened to be an exterminator.  He dealt with wasps and other bugs.  I asked if I could borrow his suit and bug spray.  He was a little apprehensive, but he agreed.  I went to my father house and suited up.  

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

""Majesty?  Who are you?  WHAT are you?"", I said to the bee.   I tried to brush it off my shoulder, but as I touched it, I quickly drew back my hand.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.

""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay. "" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  The wasps set up their nest across from ours. It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.  


WIwill! help!, I said.
  ""Send a message to your hive to evacuate for tonight.  You can come back in the morning"".  ""Yes, your majesty"", the bee said.  I had a friend who happened to be an exterminator.  He dealt with wasps and other bugs.  I asked if I could borrow his suit and bug spray.  He was a little apprehensive, but he agreed.  I went to my father house and suited up.  

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

What it did have, however, was a lot of orders.  The main order was to find the majesty.   Which I guess is me?

""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay. "" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  The wasps set up their nest across from ours. It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.  


WIwill! help!, I said.
  ""Send a message to your hive to evacuate for tonight.  You can come back in the morning"".  ""Yes, your majesty"", the bee said.  I had a friend who happened to be an exterminator.  He dealt with wasps and other bugs.  I asked if I could borrow his suit and bug spray.  He was a little apprehensive, but he agreed.  I went to my father house and suited up.  

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

He dealt with wasps and other bugs.  I asked if I could borrow his suit and bug spray.  He was a little apprehensive, but he agreed.  I went to my father house and suited up.  

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.

""Majesty?  Who are you?  WHAT are you?"", I said to the bee.   I tried to brush it off my shoulder, but as I touched it, I quickly drew back my hand.  I started seeing what must be the thoughts of the bee, but now in my head.  The bee seemed to be very young.  It didn't have a lot of thoughts in its head.  What it did have, however, was a lot of orders.  The main order was to find the majesty.   Which I guess is me?

""My clan has lived around your family for generations"", said the bee.   ""Your family has always treated us well.  We provide you with honey and your family provides us a nice place to stay. "" ""That's where my dad got all of the honey from!"", I said.   ""We generally never talk, but this is an emergency.  We need your help to stop an attack on our clan"", the bee said.   ""What attack?"", I said.

The bee proceeded to tell me about their rivals the murder hornets.  Their hive had been attacked a number of times over the past few days.  This bee managed to make it out of the hive to get help.  ""Can you help us?  Our hive is a mile from your dad's house.  The wasps set up their nest across from ours. It is on the big red oak tree"", the bee said.  


WIwill! help!, I said.
  ""Send a message to your hive to evacuate for tonight.  You can come back in the morning"".  ""Yes, your majesty"", the bee said.  I had a friend who happened to be an exterminator.  He dealt with wasps and other bugs.  I asked if I could borrow his suit and bug spray.  He was a little apprehensive, but he agreed.  I went to my father house and suited up.  

I made my way to the tree and sprayed down all of the wasps.  The wasps desperately tried to get into my suit, but it was too strong.  The fight actually wasn't that long between the wasps and me.  I estimated it took about an hour.  I knocked down the nest and made sure there were no wasps there.  As I was walking away, I saw the bee that I talked to earlier.
