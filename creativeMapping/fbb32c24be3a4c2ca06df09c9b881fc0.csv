I was happy to let the other guinea pigs get the drug.  I looked forward to the day that I checked out.  I was looking forward to the day I could be free from the pain of living.  Some of my younger friends were able to to receive the anti-death drug.   

It was definitely odd to watch the years go by.   My friends looked the same as the day that I met them.  I continued to get older.  The hair that I still had on my head went gray.  My skin started to droop.  My body ached.  My friends still like like they were fresh out of college when they were 80.  

At 85, something strange started to happen to those who had taken the pill.   Their bodies started to deteriorate.  I didn't believe it at first.  I thought it was my old mind working against me.  But, I saw one of my friends starting to get gray hair.  I saw another one of my friends starting to get wrinkles.  They were aging!  Another peculiar thing.  When my first started aging, I started feeling like I had a bit more pep in my step.  My back, which was hunched over as time went on, started to get straighter.  My drooping skin started to tighten up.  My age spots started to lighten.  

I felt like I was in my early 20s again. MY aging was reversing!  It seemed that the anti-death drug kept people from aging--for a time.  Once the drug wore off, those people who hadn't take the drug started experiencing the effects.   Now, what I didn't want to happen was occurring.  My life on this planet was extended.   I guess it is time to find something to do with my life!",user,37,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
