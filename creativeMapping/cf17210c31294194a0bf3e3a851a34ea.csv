 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

YBut you are not alone in the picture. Next to you is a the house you grew up in. our mother's house.
 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

YBut you are not alone in the picture. Next to you is a the house you grew up in. our mother's house.
 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.

 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss of,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""
And Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.

 We need to talk about your next move.""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.

Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""

Wha...?
You go to a different site.
 They've taken down all of JFK's pages. Instead, the redirect is to a page that simple has your picture on it.
YBut you are not alone in the picture. Next to you is a the house you grew up in. our mother's house.
 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss of,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""
And Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.
 A tall man with orange skin joins him. ""Hi,"" says the man. ""Don't tell me JFK tries to recruit yo",user,51,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You wonder who JFK might be. It couldn't be the JFK, he's dead. Wasn't he buried in Arlington cemetery? You're pretty sure that he was. So you google ""JFK"". His wiki page tells you that yes, he is dead. You look at more results. Half of the results tell you that he is dead, and half tell you to look at more results.
So you google his wiki page again, to make sure that the first half was right.

""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss of,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

You wonder who JFK might be. It couldn't be the JFK, he's dead. Wasn't he buried in Arlington cemetery? You're pretty sure that he was. So you google ""JFK"". His wiki page tells you that yes, he is dead. You look at more results. Half of the results tell you that he is dead, and half tell you to look at more results.
So you google his wiki page again, to make sure that the first half was right.
 But the wiki page is gone.

Wha...?
You go to a different site.
 They've taken down all of JFK's pages. Instead, the redirect is to a page that simply has your picture on it.
YBut you are not alone in the picture. Next to you is a the house you grew up in. our mother's house.
 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay?"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss fof,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""
And Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.
 A tall man with orange skin joins him. ""Hi,"" says the man. ""Don't tell me JFK tries to recruit you too?""
