The alien is keeping Matt Damon hostage and since Damon doesn't speak the alien language, he has no idea why. There are also no alien translators available so Damon can't communicate with the alien at all. 

The alien isn't torturing Damon at all. He simply has him in a room with the door locked. The windows are locked as well. Damon has no idea what planet he is on. He is basically living in isolation. 

The alien walks into the room with Matt Damon inside and to Damon's surprise, the alien starts speaking to him in English. The alien explains that the reason why Matt Damon was abducted is because Good Will Hunting is the alien's favorite movie. 

Matt Damon looks astonished and asks the alien why he would abduct him to a different planet over something like that. The alien explains that he wants Matt Damon to make a sequel. Damon negotiates a little bit with the alien and tells him that as long as he can go back to his home planet, he will make a sequel.

The alien explains that if Matt is lying, the alien can abduct him at any time, and next time they may not be as nice. Matt Damon is returned to the United States. He gets the crew back together, the movie studio is on board and Good Will Hunting 2 is made.

The movie is a box office smash and makes hundreds of millions of dollars. Matt gets home after the premiere and there is a letter waiting for him. There is also a translation device next to the letter. Obviously Matt knows that this letter is most likely from the alien. And he really hopes the alien saw and liked Good Will Hunting 2.

The alien explains that if Matt is lying, the alien can abduct him at any time, and next time they may not be as nice. Matt Damon is returned to the United States. He gets the crew back together, the movie studio is on board and Good Will Hunting 2 is made.

The movie is a box office smash and makes hundreds of millions of dollars. Matt gets home after the premiere and there is a letter waiting for him. There is also a translation device next to the letter. Obviously Matt knows that this letter is most likely from the alien. And he really hopes the alien saw and liked Good Will Hunting 2.

Luckily for Matt, the letter has nothing but positive words from the alien. The alien thanks Matt for making his dream come true and apologizes for having to go through such lengths to get it. As

There is also a translation device next to the letter. Obviously Matt knows that this letter is most likely from the alien. And he really hopes the alien saw and liked Good Will Hunting 2.

Luckily for Matt, the letter has nothing but positive words from the alien. The alien thanks Matt for making his dream come true and apologizes for having to go through such lengths to get it. As a thank you, the alien tells Matt that he is sending him a space ship that he and his family

2193,text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. Why the alien picked Matt Damon of all people? We'll never know. Sure Matt Damon is famous but the alien probably should have went with the President of the country if he wanted the United States to give into his demands.

The alien is keeping Matt Damon hostage and since Damon doesn't speak the alien language, he has no idea why. There are also no alien translators available so Damon can't communicate with the alien at all. 

The alien isn't torturing Damon at all. He simply has him in a room with the door locked. The windows are locked as well. Damon has no idea what planet he is on. He is basically living in isolation. 

The alien walks into the room with Matt Damon inside and to Damon's surprise, the alien starts speaking to him in English. The alien explains that the reason why Matt Damon was abducted is because Good Will Hunting is the alien's favorite movie. 

Matt Damon looks astonished and asks the alien why he would abduct him to a different planet over something like that. The alien explains that he wants Matt Damon to make a sequel. Damon negotiates a little bit with the alien and tells him that as long as he can go back to his home planet, he will make a sequel.

The alien explains that if Matt is lying, the alien can abduct him at any time, and next time they may not be as nice. Matt Damon is returned to the United States. He gets the crew back together, the movie studio is on board and Good Will Hunting 2 is made.

The movie is a box office smash and makes hundreds of millions of dollars. Matt gets home after the premiere and there is a letter waiting for him. There is also a translation device next to the letter. Obviously Matt knows that this letter is most likely from the alien. And he really hopes the alien saw and liked Good Will Hunting 2.

Luckily for Matt, the letter has nothing but positive words from the alien. The alien thanks Matt for making his dream come true and apologizes for having to go through such lengths to get it. As a thank you, the alien tells Matt that he is sending him a space ship that he and his family can use to get away from the p
