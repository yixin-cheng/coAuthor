Their soul mate seemed reserved and shy, which worried the shapeshifter that they would potentially scare them should they know their true identity. 
The shapeshifter dchanging into a human form ecided to acprefully aproach the person and try to get to know them, first as a friend but they were so nervous they didn't know what to say

The shapeshifter felt like they had known the person for years, and realized they were correct in believing the person was their soul mate. To their surprise, the feeling was mutual, and they were asked out by their soul mate to a date, to watch a movie together in theaters. 
The shapeshifter wagreed, and eagerly awaited the day of the date. The date would go smoothly, with both the shapeshifter and their soul mate being happy regarding the movie, while also enjoying each other's company.
