I am very famous and very rich. I own a jet and a helicopter and have a huge mansion. I have all the fame and material things I want, but I am still not happy in this life. I am lonely because all of my friends just love me for the fame. So I quit being a movie star and set out on an adventure. I traveled to many places and met many people. In Japan, they didn't even know who I was so I made true friends who loved me for me instead of the fame. I even got a simple job tending to a large garden. I was happy. But before long one of the people in my town recognized me from my movie star days. He was a big fan of mine and was very excited to see me. Then everyone found out who I used to be.

The film is my life, and I am the star. I see myself as a baby, as a child, as a teenager, as a young adult, and so on. When I am an adult, I am a woman who is a movie star in real life.  I am very famous and very rich. I own a jet and a helicopter and have a huge mansion. I have all the fame and material things I want, but I am still not happy in this life. I am lonely because all of my friends just love me for the fame. So I quit being a movie star and set out on an adventure. I traveled to many places and met many people. In Japan, they didn't even know who I was so I made true friends who loved me for me instead of the fame. I even got a simple job tending to a large garden. I was happy. But before long one of the people in my town recognized me from my movie star days. He was a big fan of mine and was very excited to see me. Then everyone found out who I used to be. I explained that I wasn't happy in that life so I came here and I want to stay here. The townspeople were happy for me and agreed not to tell my secret to the world so that I could continue living in peace with no one following me because of the fame. I remained happy anat peace for the rest of that life.",user,19,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
