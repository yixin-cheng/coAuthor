The most powerful of these teams, the Order, is led by the most powerful of all humans, the Mage. The Mage insists that humans must wage war on the alien invaders. And the Order is determined to do just that.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight. He requests that they begin to deliver the message to groups further away from The Order. Soon, everyone on earth is aware of the imminent battle. People are scared, but they are also hopeful.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. At first, they don't believe that it's happening. But as the power grows, they realize that it's not a dream. An ancient capability has taken root in the human beings who once didn't even believe in magic, or the supernatural. Soon, people begin experimenting with their power. They want to know what it can really do. And they want to know how to control it.

Schools of thought quickly form and people begin sharing information. As new abilities are identified, people begin organizing into teams, based on the level of power they have in different areas of magic. The most powerful of these teams, the Order, is led by the most powerful of all humans, the Mage. The Mage insists that humans must wage war on the alien invaders. And the Order is determined to do just that.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight. He requests that they begin to deliver the message to groups further away from The Order. Soon, everyone on earth is aware of the imminent battle. People are scared, but they are also hopeful. They are ready to fight.

War begins and the teams of people do their jobs well. They are able to hold the aliens at bay. The Order, yet to join the battle, are behind the lines conducting strategic planning sessions. They are watching the battle unfold, very carefully. They are looking for weaknesses in the enemy's defenses. The Mage believes that they have identified a way to kill the aliens, easily. They seem to be vulnerable to certain types of magic. He only needs to find out what it is about certain powers that so easily defeats the alien hoards.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight.

And the Order is determined to do just that.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight. He requests that they begin to deliver the message to groups further away from The Order. Soon, everyone on earth is aware of the imminent battle. People are scared, but they are also hopeful.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. At first, they don't believe that it's happening. But as the power grows, they realize that it's not a dream. An ancient capability has taken root in the human beings who once didn't even believe in magic, or the supernatural. Soon, people begin experimenting with their power. They want to know what it can really do. And they want to know how to control it.

Schools of thought quickly form and people begin sharing information. As new abilities are identified, people begin organizing into teams, based on the level of power they have in different areas of magic. The most powerful of these teams, the Order, is led by the most powerful of all humans, the Mage. The Mage insists that humans must wage war on the alien invaders. And the Order is determined to do just that.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight. He requests that they begin to deliver the message to groups further away from The Order. Soon, everyone on earth is aware of the imminent battle. People are scared, but they are also hopeful.

They are watching the battle unfold, very carefully. They are looking for weaknesses in the enemy's defenses. The Mage believes that they have identified a way to kill the aliens, easily. They seem to be vulnerable to certain types of magic. He only needs to find out what it is about certain powers that so easily defeats the alien hoards.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. At first, they don't believe that it's happening. But as the power grows, they realize that it's not a dream. An ancient capability has taken root in the human beings who once didn't even believe in magic, or the supernatural. Soon, people begin experimenting with their power. They want to know what it can really do. And they want to know how to control it.

Schools of thought quickly form and people begin sharing information. As new abilities are identified, people begin organizing into teams, based on the level of power they have in different areas of magic. The most powerful of these teams, the Order, is led by the most powerful of all humans, the Mage. The Mage insists that humans must wage war on the alien invaders. And the Order is determined to do just that.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight. He requests that they begin to deliver the message to groups further away from The Order. Soon, everyone on earth is aware of the imminent battle. People are scared, but they are also hopeful. They are ready to fight.

War begins and the teams of people do their jobs well. They are able to hold the aliens at bay. The Order, yet to join the battle, are behind the lines conducting strategic planning sessions. They are watching the battle unfold, very carefully. They are looking for weaknesses in the enemy's defenses. The Mage believes that they have identified a way to kill the aliens, easily. They seem to be vulnerable to certain types of magic. He only needs to find out what it is about certain powers that so easily defeats the alien hoards.

Schools of thought quickly form and people begin sharing information. As new abilities are identified, people begin organizing into teams, based on the level of power they have in different areas of magic. The most powerful of these teams, the Order, is led by the most powerful of all humans, the Mage. The Mage insists that humans must wage war on the alien invaders. And the Order is determined to do just that.

The Mage sends envoys in all directions, to begin a dialogue with other groups. His message to surrounding groups is that war is upon us all. Everyone must fight. He requests that they begin to deliver the message to groups further away from The Order. Soon, everyone on earth is aware of the imminent battle. People are scared, but they are also hopeful. They are ready to fight.

They are watching the battle unfold, very carefully. They are looking for weaknesses in the enemy's defenses. The Mage believes that they have identified a way to kill the aliens, easily. They seem to be vulnerable to certain types of magic. He only needs to find out what it is about certain powers that so easily defeats the alien hoards. 
The Order is very careful about what they do next.
 They begin using magic carefully and studying the results. They are able to identify the way to kill them all, or send them packing. The Order is ready to take the fight to the enemy.
