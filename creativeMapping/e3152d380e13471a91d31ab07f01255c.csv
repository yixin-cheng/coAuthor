The world is plunged into a manmade ice age, freezing all immortals except for a couple dozen who will work on an antidote. By this time the lost generations are all older but certain treatments have increased their lifespan as well so instead of a 100 year old person they are more like 50 year olds. 
Then it is found out that the mass chambers of cryogenic frozen bodies are starting to fail. They are unthawing and we are not done. Just then one of the lost generation's older scientists sneeze right onto a petri-dish. His snot had a latent virus, the same one he caught as a child. It kills the cells that are attacking the immortals. This rare virus that does no harm to the body and just lies dorment for the entire life span of the host is the solution to all of our problems. Then the old man chimes in and says ""well, not everybody's problems"". We will still die. Yes but humanity will live said the scientist. That gave the old man solace and he accepted his fate. He would die but the human race would go on living because of him. He would be remembered as the old man who saved humanity. One of the last old men to ever live.",user,11,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
