One day he runs into her at a coffee shop. She notices him from far away. He has a new confidence that draws her to him. She comes over and talks to him. He is polite and catches up with her but doesn't do anything to try and impress her. She catches him off guard when she asks him out on a date.

He starts to find out what makes him tick. He likes to cook. He likes horror movies. He appreciates classical music. 

As he discovers these things he spends less time obsessing about her. He's no longer constantly trying to change himself for her. He's wanting to change just to make him happy. He's also not shape shifting any more. He's discovered that is why he is the way he is. He's going to stick with this appearance.

He politely turns her down. He's made so much progress and dating her would just send him back to square one. Instead he decides to spend that time

One day he runs into her at a coffee shop. She notices him from far away. He has a new confidence that draws her to him. She comes over and talks to him. He is polite and catches up with her but doesn't do anything to try and impress her. She catches him off guard when she asks him out on a date.
