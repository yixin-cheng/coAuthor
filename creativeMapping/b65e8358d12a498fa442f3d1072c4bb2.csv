The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in.

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointmnet came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so t",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional.

He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointment came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so they can get to know each other outside of the doctor-patient context.   Jim was ecstatic, but he kept his cool. He agreed. The couple decided they were going to meet up tomorrow morning for coffee. Karen left the room after giving her ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointment came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so they can get to know each other outside of the doctor-patient context.   Jim was ecstatic, but he kept his cool. He agreed. The couple decided they were going to meet up tomorrow morning for coffee. Karen left the room after giving her number to Jim.

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointment came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so they can get to know each other outside of the doctor-patient context.   Jim was ecstatic, but he kept his cool. He agreed. The couple decided they were going to meet up tomorrow morning for coffee. Karen left the room after giving her number to Jim.

He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointment came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so they can get to know each other outside of the doctor-patient context.   Jim was ecstatic, but he kept his cool. He agreed. The couple decided they were going to meet up tomorrow morning for coffee. Karen left the room after giving her number to Jim.

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointment came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so they can get to know each other outside of the doctor-patient context.   Jim was ecstatic, but he kept his cool. He agreed. The couple decided they were going to meet up tomorrow morning for coffee. Karen left the room after giving her number to Jim.

He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

When the end of the appointment came, Karen hesitated, but then asked Jim if he wanted to get a cup of coffee sometime so they can get to know each other outside of the doctor-patient context.   Jim was ecstatic, but he kept his cool. He agreed. The couple decided they were going to meet up tomorrow morning for coffee. Karen left the room after giving her number to Jim. 

The plan worked perfectly. Jim smiled to himself, excited for the date",user,29,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2338,text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. 

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute. He also knows that she's been going to Dr. John, who is a specialist, for her asthma. So Jim set up a master plan.

He applied for a job at the medical center, knowing that Dr. John had a vacation coming up. Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.
