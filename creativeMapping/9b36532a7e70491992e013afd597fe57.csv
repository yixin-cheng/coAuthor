I read it and it says that half of the people in our world are from another reality. It's part of what is called the Mandella effect.

A mysterious man in a suit enters the room. He hands me a folder with the words ""You're our last hope"" on the cover.

I read it and it says that half of the people in our world are from another reality. It's part of what is called the Mandella effect. It says that this dial will decide which half of the population will be killed. We do not know which half is from the alternate reality and which is from our reality. This is for me to decide as part of the JFK project. 
IIf  turn the dial all the way to the right all of the people from that reality disappear.
 If I turn it to the left all the people from the other reality do. The man leaves the room and I am left to decide this for myself. 

What if I am wrong? We'll be a world filled with only people from another reality. Am I from another reality? Will I disappear as well?

A mysterious man in a suit enters the room. He hands me a folder with the words ""You're our last hope"" on the cover.

I read it and it says that half of the people in our world are from another reality. It's part of what is called the Mandella effect. It says that this dial will decide which half of the population will be killed. We do not know which half is from the alternate reality and which is from our reality. This is for me to decide as part of the JFK project. 
IIf  turn the dial all the way to the right all of the people from that reality disappear.
 If I turn it to the left all the people from the other reality do. The man leaves the room and I am left to decide this for myself. 

What if I am wrong? We'll be a world filled with only people from another reality. Am I from another reality? Will I disappear as well?

I don't want to do it but I am familiar with the JFK project. I have to do it. I close my eyes, hoping I don't disappear and turn the dial to the left. Now there is only darkness and not",user,39,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
