She tells you that it is an honor to have been called by the Almighty King of the Bees to serve as a human leader of all bees.  You just can't understand how you were tapped for this role but then Michael explains. ""Do you remember the time you had that peanut butter and honey sandwich?"" he asks.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You're shocked to hear the little voice speak to you and even more shocked to find that it belongs to a bee. The bee introduces himself as Michael and tells you not to be afraid of him.

She tells you that it is an honor to have been called by the Almighty King of the Bees to serve as a human leader of all bees.  You just can't understand how you were tapped for this role but then Michael explains. ""Do you remember the time you had that peanut butter and honey sandwich?"" he asks. ""Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it. So he decided that you would be a perfect human leader of the bees.""

""Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it.

You just can't understand how you were tapped for this role but then Michael explains. ""Do you remember the time you had that peanut butter and honey sandwich?"" he asks. ""Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it. So he decided that you would be a perfect human leader of the bees."" You are surprised that eating such a simple thing as a peanut butter and honey sandwich would land you such a title and role in the world, but it doesn't seem like you can argue more. You have been chosen. Michael says to you ""Remember, we are here to serve you."" You nod and then send the bees on their first task. You tell the bees to go far away and to not come back.

""Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it. So he decided that you would be a perfect human leader of the bees."" You are surprised that eating such a simple thing as a peanut butter and honey sandwich would land you such a title and role in the world, but it doesn't seem like you can argue more. You have been chosen. Michael says to you ""Remember, we are here to serve you."" You nod and then send the bees on their first task. You tell the bees to go far away and to not come back.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You're shocked to hear the little voice speak to you and even more shocked to find that it belongs to a bee. The bee introduces himself as Michael and tells you not to be afraid of him.

She tells you that it is an honor to have been called by the Almighty King of the Bees to serve as a human leader of all bees.  You just can't understand how you were tapped for this role but then Michael explains. ""Do you remember the time you had that peanut butter and honey sandwich?"" he asks. ""Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it.
