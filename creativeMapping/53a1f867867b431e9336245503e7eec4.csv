Today while your parents are on a phone call, a bee lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" 

Without warning, you begin to panic. You had learned that bees were dangerous to you, their stings causing you to break out in hives and bumps all over your body. Now that one was sitting on your shoulder, how were you going to get it off of you without being stung?

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you. 

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

Although you didn't understand when you were younger, your parents always worried when you left the house to play outside. They would take take precautions to watch over you whenever you played out in the grass, watching out for potential bees that might sting you. Today while your parents are on a phone call, a bee lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" 

Without warning, you begin to panic. You had learned that bees were dangerous to you, their stings causing you to break out in hives and bumps all over your body. Now that one was sitting on your shoulder, how were you going to get it off of you without being stung?

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you. 

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

Today while your parents are on a phone call, a bee lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" 

Without warning, you begin to panic. You had learned that bees were dangerous to you, their stings causing you to break out in hives and bumps all over your body. Now that one was sitting on your shoulder, how were you going to get it off of you without being stung?

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you. 

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

Although you didn't understand when you were younger, your parents always worried when you left the house to play outside. They would take take precautions to watch over you whenever you played out in the grass, watching out for potential bees that might sting you. Today while your parents are on a phone call, a bee lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" 

Without warning, you begin to panic. You had learned that bees were dangerous to you, their stings causing you to break out in hives and bumps all over your body. Now that one was sitting on your shoulder, how were you going to get it off of you without being stung?

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you. 

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

Today while your parents are on a phone call, a bee lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" 

Without warning, you begin to panic. You had learned that bees were dangerous to you, their stings causing you to break out in hives and bumps all over your body. Now that one was sitting on your shoulder, how were you going to get it off of you without being stung?

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you. 

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

You decide to talk to it, ""Are you going to sting me?"" you asked hoping it would fly off your shoulder.
""No, Your Majesty,"" it replied.
 Relieved, you realize that the bee not only understood you, but was also friendly. You wondered if the other bees you have seen in your life were also able to talk, but then focus your attention to the bee in front of you. 

""Are there other bees like you, that can talk and understand me?"" you ask, somewhat worried that you might have to deal with an army of talking bees.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" countless others who await your commands  e replied.

That's when you knew what you wanted to do.
 You decide that the friendly bees under your command would be your protectors, against other bees. You issue the command to the bee on your shoulder, who then flies off. You then head back inside, to your parents who are relieved you are safe and sound.

You don't hear from the bee you talked to for a couple of days. You begin to wonder if you actually heard from it talk as if you were royalty, wondering if it was all a part of your imagination. You were about to forget all about it, when you saw a bee flying around your room, followed by another and then another, until there were dozens. You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.

You then issue the same order as before, commanding the bees to protect you against all other insects or bees that might hurt you when you go outside. You let them sleep in your closet for protection, and they end up building a hive in the dark corner of your closet.

While your parents would worry whenever you went out to play in the near future, you felt more confident than you ever had been in your life. You no lhad an army of bees at your command, who would protect you and listen to your every whim.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You are initially startled and scared, until you realized that the bees are all friendly, the bees were all apparently under your command.
