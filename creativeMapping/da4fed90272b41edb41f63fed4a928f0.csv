I called the number only to hear dead air. No voice. No dial tone. Nothing. My thoughts start to run rampid as the fact that JFK is even alive is mind boggling. There is no way this is the real JFK, and what would he want with me? Just as i get the image of JFK out of my head my eyes awake. I hear the phone ring. There is no number but i decide to pick up anyway. The voice was very deep and shallow. ""Are you ready?"" the voice asked?  I was thrown back by the call. ""Who is this?"" I asked. ""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person.""

There was no way JFK, or whoever this individual was would have been able to contact me if they were not of high status, like a former president.

""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person.""

There was no way JFK, or whoever this individual was would have been able to contact me if they were not of high status, like a former president.

""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person.""

""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are.

I called the number only to hear dead air. No voice. No dial tone. Nothing. My thoughts start to run rampid as the fact that JFK is even alive is mind boggling. There is no way this is the real JFK, and what would he want with me? Just as i get the image of JFK out of my head my eyes awake. I hear the phone ring. There is no number but i decide to pick up anyway. The voice was very deep and shallow. ""Are you ready?"" the voice asked?  I was thrown back by the call. ""Who is this?"" I asked. ""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person."" My mind raced, but suddenly i felt  a feeling of excitment. I felt as if i had an entire new purpose at the drop of a hat, and the tone of the voice made me realize how urgent this was. There was no way JFK, or whoever this individual was would have been able to contact me if they were not of high status, like a former president. I decided to agree, and just like that was on my way to meet JFK.

I called the number only to hear dead air. No voice. No dial tone. Nothing. My thoughts start to run rampid as the fact that JFK is even alive is mind boggling. There is no way this is the real JFK, and what would he want with me? Just as i get the image of JFK out of my head my eyes awake. I hear the phone ring. There is no number but i decide to pick up anyway. The voice was very deep and shallow. ""Are you ready?"" the voice asked?  I was thrown back by the call. ""Who is this?"" I asked. ""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person."" My mind raced, but suddenly i felt  a feeling of excitment. I felt as if i had an entire new purpose at the drop of a hat, and the tone of the voice made me realize how urgent this was. There was no way JFK, or whoever this individual was would have been able to contact me if they were not of high status, like a former president. I decided to agree, and just like that was on my way to meet JFK.

I called the number only to hear dead air. No voice. No dial tone. Nothing. My thoughts start to run rampid as the fact that JFK is even alive is mind boggling. There is no way this is the real JFK, and what would he want with me? Just as i get the image of JFK out of my head my eyes awake. I hear the phone ring. There is no number but i decide to pick up anyway. The voice was very deep and shallow. ""Are you ready?"" the voice asked?  I was thrown back by the call. ""Who is this?"" I asked. ""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person."" My mind raced, but suddenly i felt  a feeling of excitment. I felt as if i had an entire new purpose at the drop of a hat, and the tone of the voice made me realize how urgent this was. There was no way JFK, or whoever this individual was would have been able to contact me if they were not of high status, like a former president. I decided to agree, and just like that was on my way to meet JFK.




I was shocked to learn that JFK lived in a normal house in a regular neighborhood.

There was no way JFK, or whoever this individual was would have been able to contact me if they were not of high status, like a former president. I decided to agree, and just like that was on my way to meet JFK.




I was shocked to learn that JFK lived in a normal house in a regular neighborhood.
 He had a hidden identity of course, along with some plastic surgery to conceal his face. He assured me that what we were doing was going to be worth our time, not only that but we would be seen as heros. He told me he was going to uncover a lot of hidden secrets that i have never know that will baffle me. He told me that everything was not real.

I called the number only to hear dead air. No voice. No dial tone. Nothing. My thoughts start to run rampid as the fact that JFK is even alive is mind boggling. There is no way this is the real JFK, and what would he want with me? Just as i get the image of JFK out of my head my eyes awake. I hear the phone ring. There is no number but i decide to pick up anyway. The voice was very deep and shallow. ""Are you ready?"" the voice asked?  I was thrown back by the call. ""Who is this?"" I asked. ""I am going to need some additional information from you before i agree to anything."" The voice paused temporarily for maybe 10 seconds. It was a long enough pause to frighten me, and then the voice said. ""I am JFK. You must not tell anyone about this. I thought i could trust you because of who you are. If you are ready to change the world for the better than let me know i can count you in. You need to trust me because i can not tell you anything else until i see you in person."" My mind raced, but suddenly i felt  a feeling of excitment. I felt as if i had an entire new purpose at the drop of a hat, and the tone of the voice made me realize how urgent this was.
