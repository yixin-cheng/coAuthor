My little dog woke me up the next morning and she was barking. ""What's wrong, girl?"" I asked. I was feeling my feet feeling itchy and flaky. Then it started happening. My feet started to disintegrate underneath me. I thought it would hurt but it didn't. My dog kept barking, then she started disintegrating into a pile of skin and bones.

Blackness came next and it felt like I was floating. Floating into the nothingness. Then I woke up. The blinding sun made me open my eyes and as soon as I was able to clearly see, I saw my wife, only she is in her early twenties. ""Hey, baby,"" she said. ""It didn't hurt, did it?""

I was astonished, shocked, and amazed. ""You're not dead,"" I said. Immediately noticing my voice sounding different, the same way I used to sound when I was younger. ""How...?'

It's just a mere week since I saw my wife disintegrate to a pile of skin and bones. We took the drug together, but I'm still alive. None of my other friends have made it. I was the only one. I can feel myself aging more and more everyday. Walking, talking, breathing, I can feel everything getting more and more difficult. I wish it would happen sooner than later.

My little dog woke me up the next morning and she was barking. ""What's wrong, girl?"" I asked. I was feeling my feet feeling itchy and flaky. Then it started happening. My feet started to disintegrate underneath me. I thought it would hurt but it didn't. My dog kept barking, then she started disintegrating into a pile of skin and bones.

Blackness came next and it felt like I was floating. Floating into the nothingness. Then I woke up. The blinding sun made me open my eyes and as soon as I was able to clearly see, I saw my wife, only she is in her early twenties. ""Hey, baby,"" she said. ""It didn't hurt, did it?""

I was astonished, shocked, and amazed. ""You're not dead,"" I said. Immediately noticing my voice sounding different, the same way I used to sound when I was younger. ""How...?'

""Too late,"" I said to myself.  ""'ve seen my mwife eteriorate into a pile of skin and bones in front of me.
 It's only a matter of time until I disintegrate myself."" 

It's just a mere week since I saw my wife disintegrate to a pile of skin and bones. We took the drug together, but I'm still alive. None of my other friends have made it. I was the only one. I can feel myself aging more and more everyday. Walking, talking, breathing, I can feel everything getting more and more difficult. I wish it would happen sooner than later.

My little dog woke me up the next morning and she was barking. ""What's wrong, girl?"" I asked. I was feeling my feet feeling itchy and flaky. Then it started happening. My feet started to disintegrate underneath me. I thought it would hurt but it didn't. My dog kept barking, then she started disintegrating into a pile of skin and bones.

Blackness came next and it felt like I was floating. Floating into the nothingness. Then I woke up. The blinding sun made me open my eyes and as soon as I was able to clearly see, I saw my wife, only she is in her early twenties. ""Hey, baby,"" she said. ""It didn't hurt, did it?""

I was astonished, shocked, and amazed. ""You're not dead,"" I said. Immediately noticing my voice sounding different, the same way I used to sound when I was younger. ""How...?'

Panic amongst the people in my neighborhood have spread after realizing that the elderly have started disintegrating after around a week of taking the drug. Hospitals have stopped administering the drug right after the news of the side effects came to light. 

""Too late,"" I said to myself.  ""'ve seen my mwife eteriorate into a pile of skin and bones in front of me.
 It's only a matter of time until I disintegrate myself."" 

It's just a mere week since I saw my wife disintegrate to a pile of skin and bones. We took the drug together, but I'm still alive. None of my other friends have made it. I was the only one. I can feel myself aging more and more everyday. Walking, talking, breathing, I can feel everything getting more and more difficult. I wish it would happen sooner than later.

My little dog woke me up the next morning and she was barking. ""What's wrong, girl?"" I asked. I was feeling my feet feeling itchy and flaky. Then it started happening. My feet started to disintegrate underneath me. I thought it would hurt but it didn't. My dog kept barking, then she started disintegrating into a pile of skin and bones.

Blackness came next and it felt like I was floating. Floating into the nothingness. Then I woke up. The blinding sun made me open my eyes and as soon as I was able to clearly see, I saw my wife, only she is in her early twenties. ""Hey, baby,"" she said. ""It didn't hurt, did it?""

I was astonished, shocked, and amazed. ""You're not dead,"" I said. Immediately noticing my voice sounding different, the same way I used to sound when I was younger. ""How...?'

Everyone we left thought we were dead. But it turns out, we were just given a second chance. Our old bodies were not sufficient to survive in the old world, but in this new one, we were able to live once again. I saw my old friends have started a colony. My wife was their leader.

It's just a mere week since I saw my wife disintegrate to a pile of skin and bones. We took the drug together, but I'm still alive. None of my other friends have made it. I was the only one.

My little dog woke me up the next morning and she was barking. ""What's wrong, girl?"" I asked. I was feeling my feet feeling itchy and flaky. Then it started happening. My feet started to disintegrate underneath me. I thought it would hurt but it didn't. My dog kept barking, then she started disintegrating into a pile of skin and bones.

I was astonished, shocked, and amazed. ""You're not dead,"" I said. Immediately noticing my voice sounding different, the same way I used to sound when I was younger. ""How...?'

My little dog woke me up the next morning and she was barking. ""What's wrong, girl?"" I asked. I was feeling my feet feeling itchy and flaky. Then it started happening. My feet started to disintegrate underneath me. I thought it would hurt but it didn't. My dog kept barking, then she started disintegrating into a pile of skin and bones.

Blackness came next and it felt like I was floating. Floating into the nothingness. Then I woke up. The blinding sun made me open my eyes and as soon as I was able to clearly see, I saw my wife, only she is in her early twenties. ""Hey, baby,"" she said. ""It didn't hurt, did it?""

I was astonished, shocked, and amazed. ""You're not dead,"" I said. Immediately noticing my voice sounding different, the same way I used to sound when I was younger. ""How...?'

Everyone we left thought we were dead. But it turns out, we were just given a second chance. Our old bodies were not sufficient to survive in the old world, but in this new one, we were able to live once again. I saw my old friends have started a colony. My wife was their leader. They were waiting for me. We dubbed this place, ""The Second Chance Land.""",user,39,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
