John is at home thinking about his situation and why no matter how good looking or in shape he becomes, he just cannot seem to connect with this women that he loves so much. He is about to give up when he hears a knock at the door. Its delivery guy with my food. He is an odd looking fellow but not in a bad way. He had a symmetrical face but with many noticeable flaws. Like his nose was uneven and crooked but added to his appeal. His eyes were a little far apart but his cheek bones more then compensated for it. Most of all though, it was his personality and mannerisms that was the most attractive thing about him. A lightbulb went off over John's head. It was not his looks that were the issue as he had thought all along but it was his personality. He was constantly trying to change it everytime he shapeshifted. This time John changed into a man who was only slightly better looking then the rest and decided he would just be himself.   ",user,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
