Unbeknownst to Max, he had hit a level that caused mana to flow through his body, temporarily bestowing him with reliable cellular connectivity. His mother grabbed the phone, looked at the screen, and noticed that at the top right, where ""AT&T 5G"" had been, it now read ""Mana 20G."" 

She made a call, her first successful one in months, and talked to a friend about how Max could now get cell service.
""HI've heard about that kind of thing,"" her friend said. ""e's got mana,
""
""That's a thing?""

""I'm pretty sure.
 My son's friend used his Mana to put ten dollars of gas in his car the other night.""
""So he's a wizard or something?"" asked Max's mother.


""Nah. It's just since the urban legend about aliens killing people,"" some ol' black magic been popping up here and there.""
""Is it dangerous?""

""No more than real magic.
""

All through Max's neighborhood, people were discovering Mana and using it to get caught up on their finances in various ways. Some used it to pay bills, some to use Uber for free, and a few were even using the power of Mana to fly passengers for cash.

No one even realized that the aliens were real until they destroyed the city of New York, and it was all captured on Mana-powered cell phones!",user,22,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
