One day, she notices something strange.  She’s been dating a guy who’s a little too perfect, and he’s a little too interested in her. It's like he knows exactly what to do and say, and he hasn't done anything that conflicts with any of her political views. he begins to suspect something is up, and she’s right.
 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

It's like he knows exactly what to do and say, and he hasn't done anything that conflicts with any of her political views. he begins to suspect something is up, and she’s right.

suggestion-get,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she notices something strange.  She’s been dating a guy who’s a little too perfect, and he’s a little too interested in her. It's like he knows exactly what to do and say, and he hasn't done anything that conflicts with any of her political views. he begins to suspect something is up, and she’s right.
 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

""Chris?"" She asks, ""Is that you?""
No,"" he replies, ""It's Sebastian.

One day, she notices something strange.  She’s been dating a guy who’s a little too perfect, and he’s a little too interested in her. It's like he knows exactly what to do and say, and he hasn't done anything that conflicts with any of her political views. he begins to suspect something is up, and she’s right.
 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

No,"" he replies, ""It's Sebastian.

 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

""Chris?"" She asks, ""Is that you?""
No,"" he replies, ""It's Sebastian.
""
""But we didn't see Avatar together, I saw that with Chris, and how else would you know that I dropped my glasses into the popcorn?""
""IFine, ''ll tell you. Im a shapeshifter,"" he says, ""I can change into anyone I want., Claire"".

""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

It turns out that Claire has been dating the same guy over and over again, and he's been trying to get it right. He's been trying to get her to fall in love with him, and he's been trying to get her to marry him. He's been trying to get her to stay with him forever, but she's always left him.

 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

""Chris?"" She asks, ""Is that you?""
No,"" he replies, ""It's Sebastian.
""
""But we didn't see Avatar together, I saw that with Chris, and how else would you know that I dropped my glasses into the popcorn?""
""IFine, ''ll tell you. Im a shapeshifter,"" he says, ""I can change into anyone I want., Claire"".

It turns out that Claire has been dating the same guy over and over again, and he's been trying to get it right. He's been trying to get her to fall in love with him, and he's been trying to get her to marry him. He's been trying to get her to stay with him forever, but she's always left him.

 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

""Chris?"" She asks, ""Is that you?""
No,"" he replies, ""It's Sebastian.
""
""But we didn't see Avatar together, I saw that with Chris, and how else would you know that I dropped my glasses into the popcorn?""
""IFine, ''ll tell you. Im a shapeshifter,"" he says, ""I can change into anyone I want., Claire"".

It turns out that Claire has been dating the same guy over and over again, and he's been trying to get it right. He's been trying to get her to fall in love with him, and he's been trying to get her to marry him. He's been trying to get her to stay with him forever, but she's always left him.

 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""

Her heart began racing. That wasn't something that happened with Sebastian. That was something that happened with her old boyfriend, Chris.

""Chris?"" She asks, ""Is that you?""
No,"" he replies, ""It's Sebastian.
""
""But we didn't see Avatar together, I saw that with Chris, and how else would you know that I dropped my glasses into the popcorn?""
""IFine, ''ll tell you. Im a shapeshifter,"" he says, ""I can change into anyone I want., Claire"".

It turns out that Claire has been dating the same guy over and over again, and he's been trying to get it right. He's been trying to get her to fall in love with him, and he's been trying to get her to marry him. He's been trying to get her to stay with him forever, but she's always left him.

""I'm glad you're finally being honest,"" Claire says.
""I'm glad you're finally seeing the real me,"" he replies.

It's like he knows exactly what to do and say, and he hasn't done anything that conflicts with any of her political views. he begins to suspect something is up, and she’s right.
 She calls the guy she's dating, Sebastian, and tries to trap him into saying something he shouldn't even know about her - one of her darkest secrets.
She succeeds, and he reveals himself.
 She doesn't let him know about the trap quite yet, though. She keeps pushing. She wants to know how he knows about her secret. ""Remember that time when we saw Avatar in 3D?"" She asks. 
""Yeah, I remember,"" he replies.
""Do you remember how I lost my glasses?""
""Yeah, you were sitting next to me, and you took them off to clean them, and you accidentally dropped them in the popcorn.""
