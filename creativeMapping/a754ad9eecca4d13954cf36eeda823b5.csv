She has no idea what to do with the news so she just runs away from his apartment. he goes home and tries to forget about the whole thing.
 Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time. He wants to learn from his failures and not accept that he truly is not the one for her. He is determined to win her over and make her his.

It is almost as if the guys are the same in a way. She has been dating a shapeshifter who is trying to get it right this time. However, she does not know this until one fateful night she catches him in the act. She goes into the bathroom and sees him shape-shifting from the guy she has been dating to someone who looks totally different. She is shocked and runs out of the bathroom. She has no idea what to do with the news so she just runs away from his apartment. he goes home and tries to forget about the whole thing.
 Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time. He wants to learn from his failures and not accept that he truly is not the one for her. He is determined to win her over and make her his. After about 2 additional years of this dating back and forth she finally decides to stop dating altogether. She decides to just be single and not date anyone. This is devastating to the shape-shifter and he has no idea what to do. He decides to go to her house and talk to her about it. He explains this is all because he loves her so much. He wants to be with her and he is willing to do anything to make it happen. She explains he is not the one for her and he never will be. He is not the one for her because she is in love with someone else.

It is almost as if the guys are the same in a way. She has been dating a shapeshifter who is trying to get it right this time. However, she does not know this until one fateful night she catches him in the act. She goes into the bathroom and sees him shape-shifting from the guy she has been dating to someone who looks totally different. She is shocked and runs out of the bathroom. She has no idea what to do with the news so she just runs away from his apartment. he goes home and tries to forget about the whole thing.
 Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time. He wants to learn from his failures and not accept that he truly is not the one for her. He is determined to win her over and make her his. After about 2 additional years of this dating back and forth she finally decides to stop dating altogether. She decides to just be single and not date anyone. This is devastating to the shape-shifter and he has no idea what to do. He decides to go to her house and talk to her about it. He explains this is all because he loves her so much. He wants to be with her and he is willing to do anything to make it happen. She explains he is not the one for her and he never will be. He is not the one for her because she is in love with someone else.
