The current from the fans could pick up large objects, like a wolf, while the rocket packs would let the pigs hover safely out of his reach.  91 and 90 each had a set, just like her. 

The wolf heard a noise in the distance. It was the 90th and 91st pig coming. He smelled them, and was very angry; he was going to eat them too! he wolf was so angry, he forgot about Felicia.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
he 92nd little pig said, ""I'm not afraid of you."" My name is Felicia Squiggletail the 5th, and you're not allowed in this house!""
he wolf said, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house in., and then eat your for dinner!"" TFeldcia laughed ""I don't think so, wolf.
 Wait one minute, and then I'll come outside."" 
The wolf agreed, thinking about the foolish pig, and how he was going to have a free meal. 
When the wolf was waiting, Felicia called the 92nd little pig's friends, the 91st little pig and the 90th little pig
. Though the wolf should have known that she was an amazing chemist and creator of gadgets because of how she safely built her house from uranium, Felicia possessed mechanical skills that would literally blow him away.  

In her spare time, Felicia had thought about how to appropriately punish the evil wolf for eating her brothers and sisters. She had developed 3 very large fans, mounted on the front of rocket packs. The current from the fans could pick up large objects, like a wolf, while the rocket packs would let the pigs hover safely out of his reach.  91 and 90 each had a set, just like her. 

The wolf heard a noise in the distance. It was the 90th and 91st pig coming. He smelled them, and was very angry; he was going to eat them too! he wolf was so angry, he forgot about Felicia.
 She came out of the house, rocket pack on, and turned on the fans. The wolf was picked up, and the pigs flew away to the river nearby,, wolf trapped in the 3 gushing streams of air. The wolf tried to bite the pigs, but they were too high up. The wolf tried to jump up, but he was too heavy.  They carried him to the river, and then dropped the wolf in it. The wolf was very angry, but he couldn't do anything.

In her spare time, Felicia had thought about how to appropriately punish the evil wolf for eating her brothers and sisters. She had developed 3 very large fans, mounted on the front of rocket packs. The current from the fans could pick up large objects, like a wolf, while the rocket packs would let the pigs hover safely out of his reach.  91 and 90 each had a set, just like her. 

The wolf heard a noise in the distance. It was the 90th and 91st pig coming. He smelled them, and was very angry; he was going to eat them too! he wolf was so angry, he forgot about Felicia.
 She came out of the house, rocket pack on, and turned on the fans. The wolf was picked up, and the pigs flew away to the river nearby,, wolf trapped in the 3 gushing streams of air. The wolf tried to bite the pigs, but they were too high up. The wolf tried to jump up, but he was too heavy.  They carried him to the river, and then dropped the wolf in it. The wolf was very angry, but he couldn't do anything.

In her spare time, Felicia had thought about how to appropriately punish the evil wolf for eating her brothers and sisters. She had developed 3 very large fans, mounted on the front of rocket packs. The current from the fans could pick up large objects, like a wolf, while the rocket packs would let the pigs hover safely out of his reach.  91 and 90 each had a set, just like her. 

The wolf heard a noise in the distance. It was the 90th and 91st pig coming. He smelled them, and was very angry; he was going to eat them too! he wolf was so angry, he forgot about Felicia.
 She came out of the house, rocket pack on, and turned on the fans. The wolf was picked up, and the pigs flew away to the river nearby,, wolf trapped in the 3 gushing streams of air. The wolf tried to bite the pigs, but they were too high up. The wolf tried to jump up, but he was too heavy.  They carried him to the river, and then dropped the wolf in it. The wolf was very angry, but he couldn't do anything.
