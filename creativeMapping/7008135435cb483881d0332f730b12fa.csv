The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks.""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family.

But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened.

But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family.

So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk.

The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold.""

The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family.

 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk.

The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house.

So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""

So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground.

The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground.""

So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house.

So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk.

The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house. The wolf was very happy because he knew the pig was going to have a great house and he was going to get the uranium that he wanted. It took the wolf 19 days to build the house but when the house was finished it was the most beautiful house in the area and even more beautiful than the one the pig had built before.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house. The wolf was very happy because he knew the pig was going to have a great house and he was going to get the uranium that he wanted.

The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws.

The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house. The wolf was very happy because he knew the pig was going to have a great house and he was going to get the uranium that he wanted. It took the wolf 19 days to build the house but when the house was finished it was the most beautiful house in the area and even more beautiful than the one the pig had built before.

The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house. The wolf was very happy because he knew the pig was going to have a great house and he was going to get the uranium that he wanted. It took the wolf 19 days to build the house but when the house was finished it was the most beautiful house in the area and even more beautiful than the one the pig had built before. The pig was very happy and thanked the wolf endlessly",user,43,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" why would you build a house of uranium ? That will never work here and it is also not safe for your family. But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk.
