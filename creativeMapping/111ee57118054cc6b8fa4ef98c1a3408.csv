“Agirl in front of you tin the line spots you and grabs you by the shoulders.

""You're one of the lucky ones,"" she weeps, nearly knocking you off your feet with her youthful strength. ""You're one of the Lost Generations, aren't you?""

It's silly that she needs to ask, because it's obvious. But you nod anyways.

Her tears fall faster. ""Please remember me,"" she sobs, flinging herself into your arms and squeezing your shoulders in a tight embrace. ""Remember all of us when we... when we...""

A young man approaches you and places his hand on her back. He also looks sad.
""We're sorry,"" he says. to you. ""For all the times people like us... well. We didn't know, of course. And we never got the choice, did we? People like us... this is the end of the line, isn't it?""
You don't know what to say.
 You have no idea what they're talking about. So you nod, hoping it might mean something to them.

Sniffling, the girl detaches from you and takes the young man's hand. ""Please remember us,"" she repeats, giving you one last mournful stare before stepping through the store door.

As the automated door shuts behind her, you realize it's covered in a large poster, marked with the seal of the government. It's a warning about the side effects of the immortality drug.
You read the poster, and the world falls out from under you.
