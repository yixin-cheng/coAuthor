The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but he couldn't blow the house down.
 He tried, but the house was made out of depleted uranium. He couldn't even dent it. So he said, ""I'm gonna go get some dynamite."" 
The wolf came back with some dynamite and tried to blow the house down, but it didn't even leave a scratch.
 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway. 

The wolf was very angry. So he said, ""I'm gonna get some nuclear weapons.!"" he wolf came back with some nuclear weapons, and he blew the house right off the face of the Earth.!
