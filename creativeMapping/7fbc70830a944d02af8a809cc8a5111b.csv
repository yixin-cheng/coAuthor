 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway.

The wolf came back with some dynamite and tried to blow the house down, but it didn't even leave a scratch.
 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway. 

The wolf was very angry. So he said, ""I'm gonna get some nuclear weapons.!"" he wolf came back with some nuclear weapons, and he blew the house right off the face of the Earth.!

The wolf looked up and saw the lightning bolts. ""Oh no,"" he said, ""It's God!"" The wolf pleaded, ""No, please. I didn't mean to blow up the house!"" God sighed and said, ""Tough titties, Wolfy.""   The wolf screamed and begged, ""No!
"" Yes,"" said God.
 
 ""This is the end,"" said God.   Lightning flashed.   The wolf screamed, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but he couldn't blow the house down.
 He tried, but the house was made out of depleted uranium. He couldn't even dent it. So he said, ""I'm gonna go get some dynamite."" 
The wolf came back with some dynamite and tried to blow the house down, but it didn't even leave a scratch.
 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway. 

The wolf was very angry. So he said, ""I'm gonna get some nuclear weapons.!"" he wolf came back with some nuclear weapons, and he blew the house right off the face of the Earth.! 

 fter the 92nd little pig was blown to smithereens, a voice from Heaven spoke and said, ""THAT'S IT
!""  Lightning flickered in the clouds. ""My chosen people, the pigs, have suffered enough at your hands!""   

The wolf looked up and saw the lightning bolts. ""Oh no,"" he said, ""It's God!"" The wolf pleaded, ""No, please. I didn't mean to blow up the house!"" God sighed and said, ""Tough titties, Wolfy."" 

he wolf screamed and begged, ""No!
"" Yes,"" said God.
 ""This is the end,"" said God.   Bright lights flashed. he wolf screamed,  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!""
 Then God sent the whole house down on top of the wolf.  The wolf was squashed like a bug. 

 God said, ""Behold -- I have created pigs with the power to not only survive but thrive in a radioactive environment.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but he couldn't blow the house down.
 He tried, but the house was made out of depleted uranium. He couldn't even dent it. So he said, ""I'm gonna go get some dynamite."" 
The wolf came back with some dynamite and tried to blow the house down, but it didn't even leave a scratch.
 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway. 

The wolf was very angry. So he said, ""I'm gonna get some nuclear weapons!"" he wolf came back with some nuclear weapons, and he blew the house right off the face of the Earth.! 

 fter the 92nd little pig was blown to smithereens, a voice from Heaven spoke and said, ""THAT'S IT
!""  Lightning flickered in the clouds. ""My chosen people, the pigs, have suffered enough at your hands!""   

The wolf looked up and saw the lightning bolts. ""Oh no,"" he said, ""It's God!"" The wolf pleaded, ""No, please. I didn't mean to blow up the house!"" God sighed and said, ""Tough titties, Wolfy."" 

he wolf screamed and begged, ""No!
"" Yes,"" said God.
 ""This is the end!""  Bright lights flashed. he wolf screamed,  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!""
 Then God sent the whole house down on top of the wolf.  The wolf was squashed like a bug. 

 God said, ""Behold -- I have created pigs with the power to not only survive but thrive in a radioactive environment.""
