He is a huge fan of the Zora Chronicles and has read all of the books. One day, a producer named Mike reaches out to Johnny. He has heard about Johnny's love and passion for the Zora Chronicles because Johnny runs a dedicated Instagram page and blog featuring content about the series. Mike asks Johnny to come to the set of the film for a special role. Johnny is absolutely thrilled. He never imagined that he could become a big-time star for his favorite series on the big screen. Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous. Johnny's friends are all big fans of the Zora Chronicles, too. But they are upset that Johnny got the role instead of them. They don't want to see Johnny succeed.

They are determined to ruin Johnny's big break. They are going to do everything they can to make sure Johnny's performance is a disaster. But Johnny is determined to prove his friends wrong. He is going to give the best performance of his life. So even though Johnny's friends repeatedly try to heckle him while he's on set, he ignores them. He decides to write them off as his friends. He is going to focus on his performance and nothing else. After all, if his friends cannot be supportive of him then he doesn't need them in his life. 
Johnny's friends are furious that Johnny is ignoring them.
 But Johnny proves to Mike that he can handle his cool, and Mike is impressed with Johnny's sensibilities in ignoring his former friends.

He is a huge fan of the Zora Chronicles and has read all of the books. One day, a producer named Mike reaches out to Johnny. He has heard about Johnny's love and passion for the Zora Chronicles because Johnny runs a dedicated Instagram page and blog featuring content about the series. Mike asks Johnny to come to the set of the film for a special role. Johnny is absolutely thrilled. He never imagined that he could become a big-time star for his favorite series on the big screen. Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous. Johnny's friends are all big fans of the Zora Chronicles, too. But they are upset that Johnny got the role instead of them. They don't want to see Johnny succeed. Johnny decides to ignore his friends' immaturity. He is determined to make the most of his opportunity. But will Johnny's friends sabotage his big chance? 

When Johnny arrives on set, Mike greets him warmly. He explains that Johnny will be playing a young boy named Johnny who is a huge fan of the Zora Chronicles. Johnny is thrilled to be playing himself. He can't wait to see himself on the big screen. But Johnny's excitement quickly turns to horror when he learns that his friends have followed him to the set. They are determined to ruin Johnny's big break. They are going to do everything they can to make sure Johnny's performance is a disaster. But Johnny is determined to prove his friends wrong. He is going to give the best performance of his life. So even though Johnny's friends repeatedly try to heckle him while he's on set, he ignores them. He decides to write them off as his friends. He is going to focus on his performance and nothing else. After all, if his friends cannot be supportive of him then he doesn't need them in his life. 
Johnny's friends are furious that Johnny is ignoring them.
 But Johnny proves to Mike that he can handle his cool, and Mike is impressed with Johnny's sensibilities in ignoring his former friends. Mike offers Johnny a full-time contract for other movies and that is how Johnny began his career in the movie industry. After that, the green-eyed monsters had nothing more to say. They felt badly about having tried to sabotage Johnny's chances and apologized to him. Johnny forgave them and they became friends again. Johnny th",user,45,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Mike asks Johnny to come to the set of the film for a special role. Johnny is absolutely thrilled. He never imagined that he could become a big-time star for his favorite series on the big screen. Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous.

 The film is expected to be released in September 2022. One little boy named Johnny is particularly excited about the release of the film. He is a huge fan of the Zora Chronicles and has read all of the books. One day, a producer named Mike reaches out to Johnny. He has heard about Johnny's love and passion for the Zora Chronicles because Johnny runs a dedicated Instagram page and blog featuring content about the series. Mike asks Johnny to come to the set of the film for a special role. Johnny is absolutely thrilled. He never imagined that he could become a big-time star for his favorite series on the big screen. Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous. Johnny's friends are all big fans of the Zora Chronicles, too. But they are upset that Johnny got the role instead of them. They don't want to see Johnny succeed. Johnny decides to ignore his friends' immaturity. He is determined to make the most of his opportunity. But will Johnny's friends sabotage his big chance?

He is going to give the best performance of his life. So even though Johnny's friends repeatedly try to heckle him while he's on set, he ignores them. He decides to write them off as his friends. He is going to focus on his performance and nothing else. After all, if his friends cannot be supportive of him then he doesn't need them in his life. 
Johnny's friends are furious that Johnny is ignoring them.
 But Johnny proves to Mike that he can handle his cool, and Mike is impressed with Johnny's sensibilities in ignoring his former friends. Mike offers Johnny a full-time contract for other movies and that is how Johnny began his career in the movie industry. After that, the green-eyed monsters had nothing more to say.

 The film is expected to be released in September 2022. One little boy named Johnny is particularly excited about the release of the film. He is a huge fan of the Zora Chronicles and has read all of the books. One day, a producer named Mike reaches out to Johnny. He has heard about Johnny's love and passion for the Zora Chronicles because Johnny runs a dedicated Instagram page and blog featuring content about the series. Mike asks Johnny to come to the set of the film for a special role. Johnny is absolutely thrilled. He never imagined that he could become a big-time star for his favorite series on the big screen. Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous. Johnny's friends are all big fans of the Zora Chronicles, too. But they are upset that Johnny got the role instead of them. They don't want to see Johnny succeed.

They are determined to ruin Johnny's big break. They are going to do everything they can to make sure Johnny's performance is a disaster. But Johnny is determined to prove his friends wrong. He is going to give the best performance of his life. So even though Johnny's friends repeatedly try to heckle him while he's on set, he ignores them. He decides to write them off as his friends. He is going to focus on his performance and nothing else. After all, if his friends cannot be supportive of him then he doesn't need them in his life. 
Johnny's friends are furious that Johnny is ignoring them.
 But Johnny proves to Mike that he can handle his cool, and Mike is impressed with Johnny's sensibilities in ignoring his former friends. Mike offers Johnny a full-time contract for other movies and that is how Johnny began his career in the movie industry. After that, the green-eyed monsters had nothing more to say.

Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous.
