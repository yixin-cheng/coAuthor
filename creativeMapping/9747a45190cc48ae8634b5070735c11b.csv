The comedy aspects of the film are simply your realization that the things you thought were important at different stages in your life really weren't that important at all. At points in our lives most of us put materialistic things on a pedestal. Money, cars, accessories, clothing, etc. The really important things are family, friends and the relationships that we have with them .

Luckily, since you're being reincarnated and have the ability to see these movies you are able to learn from your mistakes. You are then able to live a life where you know what really matters. What really should be prioritized. What really makes life valuable and meaningful.

Reincarnation is a gift. It allows us a second chance and more at life. If you had a second chance at life, what things would you change? What would you do differently?

Reincarnation can also be a bit scary. Those same friends and family that we once had won't be in our new, reincarnated life. We'll have to make new relationships, meet new friends and live with a new family. Our new family may not be as good as our old one.
