 But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What is it like to be a ghost?
 
To be a ghost is to be in purgatory.
 But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us.

It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us. That is peaceful to most humans. Why die if we can live forever?

What is it like to be a ghost?
 
To be a ghost is to be in purgatory.
 But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us. That is peaceful to most humans. Why die if we can live forever?

 But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us. That is peaceful to most humans. Why die if we can live forever?

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth.

It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us. That is peaceful to most humans. Why die if we can live forever?

What is it like to be a ghost?
 
To be a ghost is to be in purgatory.
 But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us. That is peaceful to most humans. Why die if we can live forever?

Humans have beliefs and ultimately the end of life is unknown. When you look around and look into science there are many conflicting beliefs. The world has so many different religions, and humans have a hard time to putting their faith into one set of beliefs. Ultimately you choose what you want to believe in. We will all experience death one day, and in my belief our physical bodies will be thrown away like a jacket. Our spirit will rise out of our body and ascend to heaven. We will meet our maker and live a life of eternal bliss with those who were closest to us. Life is beautiful. The af",user,47,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
