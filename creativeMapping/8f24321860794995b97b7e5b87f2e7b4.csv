 My parents were poor, and I was the youngest of three children. I had a sister who was five years older than me, and a brother who was seven years older than me. I had a normal childhood, and I had a normal life. I went to school, I did my homework, and I had friends. I was a happy kid, but I was also a lonely kid. I had no friends at school, and I had no friends at home. I was always alone. I had no one to talk to, and I had no one to play with. I had gotten so use to it that i did not really need friends anymore. I was happy with my life, and I was happy with my family. There was always drama it seems when i got a new friend and they would not stick around for long so i eventually let them go. As time went on and i met my  college sweetheart in my 2nd year of college we clicked right away and was always inseparable. We were each others first love and first kiss. After we graduated we got married and had 3 lovely kids, a boy and 2 girls. We were happy and we were a happy family. We both had great jobs and great income, took a few vacations a year and always had money for extra things. Our kids grew up and went to college as we went on with our lives. We were happy, we were content, and we were living the American dream. As time went on i got sick first and then my wife. We passed away 2 years apart from each other.
