Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing.

Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

The predictable result of this is chaos: the higher ranked dads are smug, the lower ranked dads are angry,  the middle-ranked dads are confused, and meanwhile, the mom's are off having affairs with single men who aren't involved in the whole mess. The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

Reaching the manufacturing plant, he discovers that the mugs are being fabricated by robots, who are mechanically churning out hundreds of the things a minute. They're being directed by a group of aliens, who hope to sow dissent among humanity and use the opportunity to conquer the Earth, and also to get their hands on some of those delicious human cookies. #1 Dad blows up the plant, and intimidates the aliens into giving up their plans, and leaving the Earth.

The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

Reaching the manufacturing plant, he discovers that the mugs are being fabricated by robots, who are mechanically churning out hundreds of the things a minute. They're being directed by a group of aliens, who hope to sow dissent among humanity and use the opportunity to conquer the Earth, and also to get their hands on some of those delicious human cookies. #1 Dad blows up the plant, and intimidates the aliens into giving up their plans, and leaving the Earth.

The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

Reaching the manufacturing plant, he discovers that the mugs are being fabricated by robots, who are mechanically churning out hundreds of the things a minute. They're being directed by a group of aliens, who hope to sow dissent among humanity and use the opportunity to conquer the Earth, and also to get their hands on some of those delicious human cookies. #1 Dad blows up the plant, and intimidates the aliens into giving up their plans, and leaving the Earth.

The predictable result of this is chaos: the higher ranked dads are smug, the lower ranked dads are angry,  the middle-ranked dads are confused, and meanwhile, the mom's are off having affairs with single men who aren't involved in the whole mess. The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

Reaching the manufacturing plant, he discovers that the mugs are being fabricated by robots, who are mechanically churning out hundreds of the things a minute. They're being directed by a group of aliens, who hope to sow dissent among humanity and use the opportunity to conquer the Earth, and also to get their hands on some of those delicious human cookies. #1 Dad blows up the plant, and intimidates the aliens into giving up their plans, and leaving the Earth.

The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing. Meanwhile, the ad execs are thrilled... the mugs have been selling like hotcakes, but that does nothing to help anyone except themselves, as usual. In all the chaos, the #1 dad's mug breaks and spills its contents over him. Startled back to reality by the shattered mug, and the scalding hot coffee, he's able to put himself outside the situation for a moment. Being #1 Dad, he's actually pretty wise, and patient, and far-sighted, and he begins to wonder about what's actually going on here. Where did the mugs first come from? Is it just some strange accident that they have this ranking power? Or were they created for some more specific purpose?

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

Reaching the manufacturing plant, he discovers that the mugs are being fabricated by robots, who are mechanically churning out hundreds of the things a minute. They're being directed by a group of aliens, who hope to sow dissent among humanity and use the opportunity to conquer the Earth, and also to get their hands on some of those delicious human cookies. #1 Dad blows up the plant, and intimidates the aliens into giving up their plans, and leaving the Earth.

The predictable result of this is chaos: the higher ranked dads are smug, the lower ranked dads are angry,  the middle-ranked dads are confused, and meanwhile, the mom's are off having affairs with single men who aren't involved in the whole mess. The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

Long story short; it's a real mess, to the extent that civilization is on the verge of collapsing.

As befits a #1 Dad, he's also pretty curious, and a real badass once he takes off his Dad suit and puts on his combat fatigues. He travels to the advertising firm that was responsible for the ad campaign, and demands to know who put them up to this. He finds that the origin of the mugs is a mysterious group called ""The Council"", who apparently control the entire ad industry. He shakes down the head of the advertising firm, and finds out where they're located, and books a flight to a remote Pacific Island.

Reaching the manufacturing plant, he discovers that the mugs are being fabricated by robots, who are mechanically churning out hundreds of the things a minute. They're being directed by a group of aliens, who hope to sow dissent among humanity and use the opportunity to conquer the Earth, and also to get their hands on some of those delicious human cookies. #1 Dad blows up the plant, and intimidates the aliens into giving up their plans, and leaving the Earth.
