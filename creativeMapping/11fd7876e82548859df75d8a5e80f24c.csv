The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing?

The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day.

So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.

 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this.

 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.

Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this.

The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this.

Smith had built his house out of lead.

 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this.

The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world.

 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down.

So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile.

 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this.

 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house.

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. 
The predator was a flarge ox.

. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. 
The predator was a flarge ox.

 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. 
The predator was a flarge ox.

So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. 
The predator was a flarge ox.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house.

There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator.

 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house.

 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing?

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing

Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing?

 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down.

 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf.

 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. 
The predator was a flarge ox.
 The fox spotted the wolf and gulped him down. And that was the end of the little pig's worries. He no longer needed to be concerned that anyone would ever be a threat to his brothers or sisters ever again",user,51,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down. After all, the little pig, whose name was Dr. Cornelius Oliver, was destined to become a famed scientist. There was no way that he was going to allow some wolf to blow down his house, not when he had taken such great care to construct his house with the most scientifically sound material in the world. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
