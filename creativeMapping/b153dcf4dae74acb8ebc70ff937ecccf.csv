2095,text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He will change a million times if he has to until he finds the perfection combination of attractive features. He has mastered the art of getting her to accept a first date but can never get her to accept a second one. He starts to get impatient and decides to stalk her on the internet. He pays a private detective to get all the information on a possible match that he can get. The detective comes through and provides him with all the new information he could have wished for. He knows about all her old relationships and can read or hear every communication between them. He starts to find out her likes, dislikes and things that he would never even imagine. Finally, he uses an algorithm that takes all the information and combines it into one avatar that the shapeshifter then imitates perfectly down to every last hair follicle. He is now ready to go on the date. He goes to pick her up, she is almost speechless when she sees him. He has dressed to impress (very specifically).  He has the perfect hairstyle, the perfect clothes, the perfect shoes, the perfect car, the perfect cologne, the perfect everything. He then takes her to her favorite restaurant without even asking her where she wanted to go. He got her favorite table and ordered her favorite dish all without asking her. She was beyond impressed. He was perfect. Then as fast as the shapeshifter could blink, he was staring at a mirror image of himself.
