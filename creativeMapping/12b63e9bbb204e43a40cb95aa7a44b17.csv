 The bee just asks the same question again, ""what are your orders?"" You give up and tell the bee that your orders are to give you more information about this strange situation.

Further, the bee tells you that you have been kept away from bees for all of this time, because they didn't want you to know that you are royalty, until you had lived a normal life. The bees believed that you would be a better leader with this background.   

The bee then tells you that you have been chosen to lead the bees in a war against the humans. This really takes you by surprise, because you have always lived as a human.
