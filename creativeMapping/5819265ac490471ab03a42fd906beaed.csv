They were unable to perceive the world around them, although there own bodies appeared to walk and move without their input. The drug makers had no real explanation for this phenomenon, but offered a simple fix. They assured the drug users that a new drug would become available that would treat their symptoms, and that would allow them to continue their lives normally. Many accepted it, and were soon administered the drug. However, time soon proved that the drug was nothing more than a placebo, and it did nothing to alleviate their symptoms.

The drug makers had no real explanation for this phenomenon, but offered a simple fix.

 Protests rang all across the world from those who could not afford the drug, demanding the drug makers to make the drug more affordable and accessible to all. Their pleas and protests went unheard, and overtime the protests ceased as people accepted they would not be able to take the drug to extend their lives.

The year is now 2078, and the drug has allowed many that could have afforded the drugs to live longer lives, some up to the age of 150. However, as they aged, the drug had not prevented the eventual deterioration of their mental processes. Many still possessed their physical strength and health, but their mental capacity was slowly slipping. They were unable to perceive the world around them, although there own bodies appeared to walk and move without their input. The drug makers had no real explanation for this phenomenon, but offered a simple fix. They assured the drug users that a new drug would become available that would treat their symptoms, and that would allow them to continue their lives normally. Many accepted it, and were soon administered the drug. However, time soon proved that the drug was nothing more than a placebo, and it did nothing to alleviate their symptoms. The drug makers were not able to produce a treatment or cure for the symptoms, nor did they feel a strong urgency to research further into finding one. Most of the users would eventually become unable to protest or complain to the company, and those that didn't take the drug had stopped caring about wanting to use it a long time ago.
