The drug makers had no real explanation for this phenomenon, but offered a simple fix. They assured the drug users that a new drug would become available that would treat their symptoms, and that would allow them to continue their lives normally. Many accepted it, and were soon administered the drug. However, time soon proved that the drug was nothing more than a placebo, and it did nothing to alleviate their symptoms. The drug makers were not able to produce a treatment or cure for the symptoms, nor did they feel a strong urgency to research further into finding one.

text-insert,"In the year 2052, several media channels report on the discovery of a new drug, a pill that scientists claim would extend the lives of those that took it. It would as they claim, help the body recover and regenerate faster from injuries, as well as reduce the likelihood of disease. Unfortunately, the drug was quite costly, and would not be affordable for the majority of the people of Earth. The drug was thus distributed primarily to the wealthy and rich, who could easily afford the drug. s is expected, the scientists that created the drug made large amounts of money in sales.
 Protests rang all across the world from those who could not afford the drug, demanding the drug makers to make the drug more affordable and accessible to all. Their pleas and protests went unheard, and overtime the protests ceased as people accepted they would not be able to take the drug to extend their lives.

The year is now 2078, and the drug has allowed many that could have afforded the drugs to live longer lives, some up to the age of 150. However, as they aged, the drug had not prevented the eventual deterioration of their mental processes. Many still possessed their physical strength and health, but their mental capacity was slowly slipping. They were unable to perceive the world around them, although there own bodies appeared to walk and move without their input. The drug makers had no real explanation for this phenomenon, but offered a simple fix. They assured the drug users that a new drug would become available that would treat their symptoms, and that would allow them to continue their lives normally. Many accepted it, and were soon administered the drug. However, time soon proved that the drug was nothing more than a placebo, and it did nothing to alleviate their symptoms. The drug makers were not able to produce a treatment or cure for the symptoms, nor did they feel a strong urgency to research further into finding one. Most of the users would eventually become unable to protest or complain to the company, and those that didn't take the drug had stopped caring about wanting to use it a long time ago.
As of now, the drug ihas ceased being distributed. Although some have found itself in Black Markets to be purchased at exorbitant prices, many have decided against buying the drug. For its users still live as a bitter reminder of what the drug ultimately causes in due time to the user. The drug had not prevented people from suffering from disease or disability, it could only prolong the inevitable, as the users would cease mental functions and find themselves no longer control of their bodies.",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
