One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.

 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

 am not a cat, but a shapeshifter.
 And I love you. That trendy vicar? That 25 year old slacker with acne? That lion of Wall Street with the attitude? They were all....me!

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

 am not a cat, but a shapeshifter.
 And I love you. That trendy vicar? That 25 year old slacker with acne? That lion of Wall Street with the attitude? They were all....me!

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

 am not a cat, but a shapeshifter.
 And I love you. That trendy vicar? That 25 year old slacker with acne? That lion of Wall Street with the attitude? They were all....me!
I have been trying to get it right, but I never seem to.
 So this is my last chance! Take me home! Please! Feed me and love me. I will be your best friend for life!

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

 am not a cat, but a shapeshifter.
 And I love you. That trendy vicar? That 25 year old slacker with acne? That lion of Wall Street with the attitude? They were all....me!
I have been trying to get it right, but I never seem to.
 So this is my last chance! Take me home! Please! Feed me and love me. I will be your best friend for life!

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

 am not a cat, but a shapeshifter.
 And I love you. That trendy vicar? That 25 year old slacker with acne? That lion of Wall Street with the attitude? They were all....me!
I have been trying to get it right, but I never seem to.
 So this is my last chance! Take me home! Please! Feed me and love me. I will be your best friend for life!

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

The woman is dumbfounded.

After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

One day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.
She decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy.
 She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.

Now she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.
The woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy.
 She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.

BY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”

She opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:

By the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.
The woman is dumbfounded.
 She reads on.

 am not a cat, but a shapeshifter.
 And I love you. That trendy vicar? That 25 year old slacker with acne? That lion of Wall Street with the attitude? They were all....me!
I have been trying to get it right, but I never seem to.
 So this is my last chance! Take me home! Please! Feed me and love me. I will be your best friend for life!
