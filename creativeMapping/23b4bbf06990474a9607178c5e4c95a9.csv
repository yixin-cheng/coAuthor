When it was her turn, the nurse attending to her initially declined to give her the drug, but Rosa convinced her by saying, ""I'm old, I'm tired, I'm ready to die. Just give me the drug, kid."" 

Hesitantly the nurse gave her the drug. She listed several side effects, including fever, nausea, and other common side effects.  Rosa was not listening as she took the drug and drank water from her water bottle to push it through her body. Last on the list of side effects, the nurse said, ""there's a very little chance of people over the age of 85 to become a giant... like a giant rat.""

Right as the nurse said the word rat, Rosa puffed like a giant balloon with fur and long nose, and with a tail. She is now a giant rat. Rosa exclaimed, ""I'm a giant rat!"" walking away from the nurse very fast, and very nimble. She then went to the streets to eat garbage. Onlookers were terrified. ""Not again!"" said one person. ""I told you it was a bad idea to give the drug to old people!"" said another.
