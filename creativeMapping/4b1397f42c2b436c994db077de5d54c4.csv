It was entirely different world with different nations being the most powerful and some nations were not even around anymore. 
IThe entirety of mainland Asia was now either Russia, China, or India, with Japan off doing its own thing and staying independent and neutral. Most of Africa was taken over by Egypt and Saudi Arabia and most of the countries in Europe formed together to make larger, more power nations. Norway, Sweden, and Finland were now just Scandinavia and all of the nations in the United Kingdom officially formed together and became just The United Kingdoms of England.  All of Latin America formed into the Union, with the exception of Mexico and Cuba. Cuba remained independent and neutral and served as a major port hub for other nations so they were enjoying a new era of riches and prosperity. 

The US was looking for an ally because everything was so shaken up, so they turned to their neighbors of the North; the always neutral, always friendly, Canada. Canada had stayed out of the war and stayed neutral throughout it even though it was constantly cajoled by France and Spain to join the war. Canada's leaders ignored the calls but it turned out that keeping quiet wasn't enough to keep them out of this war. Because they stayed out, they also were enjoying an era of prosperity. 

The world was a new and scary place, and the US was going to have to be careful navigating the new political climate as they try to find their new place in the world. Undoubtedly, they would not be considered a superpower anymore because they had nothing to do with any conflicts in the past 50 years. They were now considered a middle country like Canada and Cuba.

IThe entirety of mainland Asia was now either Russia, China, or India, with Japan off doing its own thing and staying independent and neutral. Most of Africa was taken over by Egypt and Saudi Arabia and most of the countries in Europe formed together to make larger, more power nations.

Cuba remained independent and neutral and served as a major port hub for other nations so they were enjoying a new era of riches and prosperity. 

The US was looking for an ally because everything was so shaken up, so they turned to their neighbors of the North; the always neutral, always friendly, Canada. Canada had stayed out of the war and stayed neutral throughout it even though it was constantly cajoled by France and Spain to join the war. Canada's leaders ignored the calls but it turned out that keeping quiet wasn't enough to keep them out of this war. Because they stayed out, they also were enjoying an era of prosperity. 

The world was a new and scary place, and the US was going to have to be careful navigating the new political climate as they try to find their new place in the world. Undoubtedly, they would not be considered a superpower anymore because they had nothing to do with any conflicts in the past 50 years. They were now considered a middle country like Canada and Cuba.

The US was looking for an ally because everything was so shaken up, so they turned to their neighbors of the North; the always neutral, always friendly, Canada. Canada had stayed out of the war and stayed neutral throughout it even though it was constantly cajoled by France and Spain to join the war. Canada's leaders ignored the calls but it turned out that keeping quiet wasn't enough to keep them out of this war. Because they stayed out, they also were enjoying an era of prosperity. 

The world was a new and scary place, and the US was going to have to be careful navigating the new political climate as they try to find their new place in the world.

Norway, Sweden, and Finland were now just Scandinavia and all of the nations in the United Kingdom officially formed together and became just The United Kingdoms of England.

Canada had stayed out of the war and stayed neutral throughout it even though it was constantly cajoled by France and Spain to join the war. Canada's leaders ignored the calls but it turned out that keeping quiet wasn't enough to keep them out of this war. Because they stayed out, they also were enjoying an era of prosperity. 

The world was a new and scary place, and the US was going to have to be careful navigating the new political climate as they try to find their new place in the world. Undoubtedly, they would not be considered a superpower anymore because they had nothing to do with any conflicts in the past 50 years.
