I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die.""

You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders.

You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it. So at that moment i did not know what to do as i started to panic and tried not to get too excited and become nervous so that it senses my senses and bite me. You think to yourself, ""What do I do? I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die."" You try to shake it off, but it doesn't budge. so i remain as calm as possible and try to walk it off and hoping it was going to fly away which she didn't no matter what . You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over. At that time i noticed it had disappeared off of me and felt so relieved. Fr ",user,33,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them.

You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die.""

You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die."" You try to shake it off, but it doesn't budge. so i remain as calm as possible and try to walk it off and hoping it was going to fly away which she didn't no matter what . You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over.

You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees.

You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them.

You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it. So at that moment i did not know what to do as i started to panic and tried not to get too excited and become nervous so that it senses my senses and bite me. You think to yourself, ""What do I do? I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die."" You try to shake it off, but it doesn't budge. so i remain as calm as possible and try to walk it off and hoping it was going to fly away which she didn't no matter what . You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over. At that time i noticed it had disappeared off of me and felt so relieved. From that moment on i made sure i sprayed myself with bug spray whenever i went out especially in grassy areas like the park or flower gar ",user,33,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over.

You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it. So at that moment i did not know what to do as i started to panic and tried not to get too excited and become nervous so that it senses my senses and bite me. You think to yourself, ""What do I do? I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die."" You try to shake it off, but it doesn't budge. so i remain as calm as possible and try to walk it off and hoping it was going to fly away which she didn't no matter what . You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over. At that time i noticed it had disappeared off of me and felt so relieved. From that moment on i made sure i sprayed myself with bug spray whenever i went out especially in grassy areas like the park or flower gardens.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over.

You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them.

You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees.

You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it. So at that moment i did not know what to do as i started to panic and tried not to get too excited and become nervous so that it senses my senses and bite me. You think to yourself, ""What do I do? I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die."" You try to shake it off, but it doesn't budge. so i remain as calm as possible and try to walk it off and hoping it was going to fly away which she didn't no matter what . You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over. At that time i noticed it had disappeared off of me and felt so relieved. From that moment on i made sure i sprayed myself with bug spray whenever i went out especially in grassy areas like the park or flower gardens. And i also made sure i always carried a small can of spray with me wherever i go from then on just to be on the safe side.  ",user,34,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary.
