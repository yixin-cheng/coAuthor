 People began to panic. This was proof that someone was paying attention to everything we do. This was not good. 
The next day, all of the ""#1 Grandpa"" mugs changed to show the actual ranking of Grandpas.
 More evidence that we were being watched, and that there was indeed a lot of judgement going on, behind the scenes. The implications of this were such, that people began to analyze their own behavior.

People weren't analyzing their behavior, when they were out in public and others could see them. They had already analyzed that to death. People were starting to analyze the behavior they only exhibit when they believe themselves to be alone. This behavior was far too often embarrassing, and this new revelation, that someone is watching and judging, was very scary.

People began doing things differently. Suddenly, just as suddenly as the Dad mugs had changed, food pantries filled with the best tasting foods. Shortly thereafter, a new policy came out of the Airbnb community. They would no longer be charging people who wish to stay in their extra houses. No more homelessness. Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.

People were their same old selves, out in public. What had changed was what they did in the shadows. They were being their best selves, in the shadows. They were being as decent when they were alone, as they would tend to be out in public. That made a big enough difference to change the world.

 More evidence that we were being watched, and that there was indeed a lot of judgement going on, behind the scenes. The implications of this were such, that people began to analyze their own behavior.

People weren't analyzing their behavior, when they were out in public and others could see them. They had already analyzed that to death.

Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.

 More evidence that we were being watched, and that there was indeed a lot of judgement going on, behind the scenes. The implications of this were such, that people began to analyze their own behavior.

People weren't analyzing their behavior, when they were out in public and others could see them. They had already analyzed that to death. People were starting to analyze the behavior they only exhibit when they believe themselves to be alone. This behavior was far too often embarrassing, and this new revelation, that someone is watching and judging, was very scary.

People began doing things differently. Suddenly, just as suddenly as the Dad mugs had changed, food pantries filled with the best tasting foods. Shortly thereafter, a new policy came out of the Airbnb community. They would no longer be charging people who wish to stay in their extra houses. No more homelessness. Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.

People were their same old selves, out in public. What had changed was what they did in the shadows. They were being their best selves, in the shadows. They were being as decent when they were alone, as they would tend to be out in public. That made a big enough difference to change the world.

 More evidence that we were being watched, and that there was indeed a lot of judgement going on, behind the scenes. The implications of this were such, that people began to analyze their own behavior.

People weren't analyzing their behavior, when they were out in public and others could see them. They had already analyzed that to death. People were starting to analyze the behavior they only exhibit when they believe themselves to be alone. This behavior was far too often embarrassing, and this new revelation, that someone is watching and judging, was very scary.

People began doing things differently. Suddenly, just as suddenly as the Dad mugs had changed, food pantries filled with the best tasting foods. Shortly thereafter, a new policy came out of the Airbnb community. They would no longer be charging people who wish to stay in their extra houses. No more homelessness. Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.

People were their same old selves, out in public. What had changed was what they did in the shadows. They were being their best selves, in the shadows. They were being as decent when they were alone, as they would tend to be out in public. That made a big enough difference to change the world.

 More evidence that we were being watched, and that there was indeed a lot of judgement going on, behind the scenes. The implications of this were such, that people began to analyze their own behavior.

People weren't analyzing their behavior, when they were out in public and others could see them. They had already analyzed that to death. People were starting to analyze the behavior they only exhibit when they believe themselves to be alone. This behavior was far too often embarrassing, and this new revelation, that someone is watching and judging, was very scary.

Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.
