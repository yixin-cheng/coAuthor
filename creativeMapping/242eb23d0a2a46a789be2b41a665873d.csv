When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. What is the nature of this power? And what is its purpose? Is it a blessing, or a curse?

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.  It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years.

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.  It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying.

He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying.

He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders.

The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years.

He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change.

Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all.

He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.  It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife.

Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change.

She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife.

He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.

Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population.

They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife.

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.  It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.
