The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude.

Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust.

I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family.

He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eati",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pret",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude.

Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs.

Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude.

He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

The wolf pack hesitated for a moment, surprised by this strange creature that talked, and se",user,34,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

The wolf pack hesitated for a moment, surprised by this strange creature that talked, and seemed to have no fear of them. After that moment, of course, they fell on him and tore him to pieces. That's what wolves do, after a",user,36,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like ""That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.
