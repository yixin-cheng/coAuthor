1646,text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.

Was it magic? Aliens? Foreign conspiracy? An elaborate hoax? No one seemed to know. But all of those kitschy mugs were suddenly more than just mugs. 

No one was really sure what to do. Should they throw them away? But they had been gifts from kids for the most part. One of the best gifts a Dads can receive. 
So most people just kept them in their kitchens.
 But it became taboo to talk about what number was on your mug. At least among the adults. It was all the talk among the kids. Which could make things very awkward for the adults. 
The adults aound out that the mugs had to be paired up.
 If they were placed next to a #1 Mom mug they went back to normal. Or something close to normal. 

But now there was a different kind of awkwardness - what about households with no moms? That was a conversation no one wanted to have.

Eventually a movement formed. A group called ""The Mugs of Equality"" started producing and distributing a new kind of mug. The #1 Family mug. Everyone who turned in a #1 Dad mug got a #1 Family mug in exchange. The group distributed them at churches, schools and community events. And all mug makers agreed not to make #1 Dad mugs anymore. It was the perfect solution. People were still uneasy not knowing why the mugs had gone weird to begin with, but since there were no more #1 Dad mugs, it wasn't as big of an issue. A happy ending to a troubling situation.
