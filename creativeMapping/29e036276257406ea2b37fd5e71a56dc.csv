Her mom Soeurette is about to get remarried in less than a month, and the wedding has put a lot of strain on your family because Soeurette is quite frankly crazy and mentally ill. You've been trying to be the best Dad you can be, but you're not sure if it's enough.

You see that you're ranked #530, and you're not sure how to feel about that because you're not sure what the rankings mean. After all, under any stretch of the imagination, you're not a bad Dad. You enjoy taking Harper out for ice cream cones and always let her order sprinkles and jimmies and whipped cream and crushed Oreos and chocolate sauce and cherries and gummy bears and M&Ms and Skittles and Mounds bars and Snickers bars and Reese's Pieces to add on top of her sundaes.

You ask Harper how she wants to spend her dream day with you and she says she wants to go to the zoo, the beach, and the park. You know this is a lot to fit in into one day but you're up for the challenge. So, the two of you set off on your adventure. You enjoy a fabulous day together laughing and bonding. You take Harper out for lunch at a great restaurant and you both order your favorite meals. For Harper, this is a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of French fries and a chocolate milkshake. And for you, this is a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. The two of you love chocolate milkshakes, what can you say? Harper is her father's daughter after all. Anyway, Harper ends up loving the day out.

You see the mug changing while you're eating a big breakfast which includes a stack of pancakes, French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, and hash browns. Yum! You study the mug to investigate your ranking. Things have been tough with your daughter Harper lately, because she's been acting out. Her mom Soeurette is about to get remarried in less than a month, and the wedding has put a lot of strain on your family because Soeurette is quite frankly crazy and mentally ill. You've been trying to be the best Dad you can be, but you're not sure if it's enough.

You see that you're ranked #530, and you're not sure how to feel about that because you're not sure what the rankings mean. After all, under any stretch of the imagination, you're not a bad Dad. You enjoy taking Harper out for ice cream cones and always let her order sprinkles and jimmies and whipped cream and crushed Oreos and chocolate sauce and cherries and gummy bears and M&Ms and Skittles and Mounds bars and Snickers bars and Reese's Pieces to add on top of her sundaes. You also enjoy taking Harper to the park to play and people watch. And anyways, how many dads are there in the world anyway? 
You look at the rankings again and see that you're ranked #530 out of 5,000,000,000.
 This means you are in an elite group of top dads. You're in the top 0.00000001% of all dads in the world.

You wish you could be a better dad to Harper since she deserves you to be the best dad in the world. So, you decide to do something about it. You ask Harper how she wants to spend her dream day with you and she says she wants to go to the zoo, the beach, and the park. You know this is a lot to fit in into one day but you're up for the challenge. So, the two of you set off on your adventure. You enjoy a fabulous day together laughing and bonding. You take Harper out for lunch at a great restaurant and you both order your favorite meals. For Harper, this is a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of French fries and a chocolate milkshake. And for you, this is a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. The two of you love chocolate milkshakes, what can you say? Harper is her father's daughter after all. Anyway, Harper ends up loving the day out. She tells you she really appreciates that you were willing to make the time for her today, because lately she's been feeling pushed to the side since Soeurette has been spending so much time with her fiancé and planning the wedding.

You see the mug changing while you're eating a big breakfast which includes a stack of pancakes, French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, and hash browns. Yum! You study the mug to investigate your ranking. Things have been tough with your daughter Harper lately, because she's been acting out. Her mom Soeurette is about to get remarried in less than a month, and the wedding has put a lot of strain on your family because Soeurette is quite frankly crazy and mentally ill. You've been trying to be the best Dad you can be, but you're not sure if it's enough.

You see that you're ranked #530, and you're not sure how to feel about that because you're not sure what the rankings mean. After all, under any stretch of the imagination, you're not a bad Dad. You enjoy taking Harper out for ice cream cones and always let her order sprinkles and jimmies and whipped cream and crushed Oreos and chocolate sauce and cherries and gummy bears and M&Ms and Skittles and Mounds bars and Snickers bars and Reese's Pieces to add on top of her sundaes. You also enjoy taking Harper to the park to play and people watch. And anyways, how many dads are there in the world anyway? 
You look at the rankings again and see that you're ranked #530 out of 5,000,000,000.
 This means you are in an elite group of top dads. You're in the top 0.00000001% of all dads in the world. But at the same time, this means that there are 529 dads who are better at fatherhood than you, and you're not sure how to feel about that. You wish you could be a better dad to Harper since she deserves you to be the best dad in the world. So, you decide to do something about it. You ask Harper how she wants to spend her dream day with you and she says she wants to go to the zoo, the beach, and the park. You know this is a lot to fit in into one day but you're up for the challenge. So, the two of you set off on your adventure. You enjoy a fabulous day together laughing and bonding. You take Harper out for lunch at a great restaurant and you both order your favorite meals. For Harper, this is a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of French fries and a chocolate milkshake. And for you, this is a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. The two of you love chocolate milkshakes, what can you say? Harper is her father's daughter after all. Anyway, Harper ends up loving the day out. She tells you she really appreciates that you were willing to make the time for her today, because lately she's been feeling pushed to the side since Soeurette has been spending so much time with her fiancé and planning the wedding. You are happy to be there for your daughter. When you get home, you check your mug again. You are pleasantly surprised to see that you have moved up in the rankings. You are now ranked #499.

You see that you're ranked #530, and you're not sure how to feel about that because you're not sure what the rankings mean. After all, under any stretch of the imagination, you're not a bad Dad. You enjoy taking Harper out for ice cream cones and always let her order sprinkles and jimmies and whipped cream and crushed Oreos and chocolate sauce and cherries and gummy bears and M&Ms and Skittles and Mounds bars and Snickers bars and Reese's Pieces to add on top of her sundaes.

You take Harper out for lunch at a great restaurant and you both order your favorite meals. For Harper, this is a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of French fries and a chocolate milkshake. And for you, this is a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. The two of you love chocolate milkshakes, what can you say? Harper is her father's daughter after all. Anyway, Harper ends up loving the day out.

But at the same time, this means that there are 529 dads who are better at fatherhood than you, and you're not sure how to feel about that. You wish you could be a better dad to Harper since she deserves you to be the best dad in the world. So, you decide to do something about it. You ask Harper how she wants to spend her dream day with you and she says she wants to go to the zoo, the beach, and the park. You know this is a lot to fit in into one day but you're up for the challenge. So, the two of you set off on your adventure. You enjoy a fabulous day together laughing and bonding. You take Harper out for lunch at a great restaurant and you both order your favorite meals. For Harper, this is a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of French fries and a chocolate milkshake. And for you, this is a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. The two of you love chocolate milkshakes, what can you say? Harper is her father's daughter after all. Anyway, Harper ends up loving the day out. She tells you she really appreciates that you were willing to make the time for her today, because lately she's been feeling pushed to the side since Soeurette has been spending so much time with her fiancé and planning the wedding. You are happy to be there for your daughter. When you get home, you check your mug again. You are pleasantly surprised to see that you have moved up in the rankings. You are now ranked #499.

Her mom Soeurette is about to get remarried in less than a month, and the wedding has put a lot of strain on your family because Soeurette is quite frankly crazy and mentally ill. You've been trying to be the best Dad you can be, but you're not sure if it's enough.

You see that you're ranked #530, and you're not sure how to feel about that because you're not sure what the rankings mean. After all, under any stretch of the imagination, you're not a bad Dad. You enjoy taking Harper out for ice cream cones and always let her order sprinkles and jimmies and whipped cream and crushed Oreos and chocolate sauce and cherries and gummy bears and M&Ms and Skittles and Mounds bars and Snickers bars and Reese's Pieces to add on top of her sundaes. You also enjoy taking Harper to the park to play and people watch. And anyways, how many dads are there in the world anyway?
