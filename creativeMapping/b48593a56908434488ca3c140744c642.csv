Dad's all over the world were confused as to why they deserved this kind of treatment. There was a day of protest on Father's Day. Dads all over brought their mugs to the streets and started smashing them on the roads, shattering them to pieces.

We are doing this because some dads are really bad and are not even there for their kids."" other mugs wrote the message that they were themselves just doing what was expected of them and did not have a choice in the matter. Many wrote that they didn't want to be mugs at all and would rather be other items like trash cans, tricycles or even cars.

Dads understood, but did not know how to give the mugs what they wanted so they searched the internet for advice.
