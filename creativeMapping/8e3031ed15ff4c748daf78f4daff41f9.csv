The United States first contacted its former allies - United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada to get the information on what went on with the agreement. Canada was first to say that they didn't go into isolation, but the UK and Australia both said that they did.

The United States first contacted its former allies - United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada to get the information on what went on with the agreement. Canada was first to say that they didn't go into isolation, but the UK and Australia both said that they did. But only less than half of the countries isolate in the beginning, and just a mere year later, almost everyone was back to normal. The countries said that it was best for the United States to not be informed about the non-isolation because of the fact that the US was the one who started the war. The representative from Australia argued that the world would be back at war if the US did not isolate.

President of the United States, David Palmer, has been informed of the situation and has been given the option to either start a war or to stay in isolation.
