You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.

You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.

You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.

You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.

You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming.

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door.

Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot? Is there anyway to rig the list? Is there anyone in the world that you can bribe to make them tell you where they ranked, or what their ranking was? You have to formulate a plan soon since you expect your mug to arrive in the mail any day now.

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door. The delivery box is still in your hands and you realize you need to find a way to get rid of it. As you are contemplating whether you should burn it or just trash it, you catch a glimpse of the address. Are you kidding me?! The address is ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Because you have no idea how to make yourself suddenly be #1. You have always thought you were a good father, but the top honor? Maybe you haven't been good enough. Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot? Is there anyway to rig the list? Is there anyone in the world that you can bribe to make them tell you where they ranked, or what their ranking was?

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door. The delivery box is still in your hands and you realize you need to find a way to get rid of it.

 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door.

Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot?

 Because you have no idea how to make yourself suddenly be #1. You have always thought you were a good father, but the top honor? Maybe you haven't been good enough. Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot?

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door.

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door. The delivery box is still in your hands and you realize you need to find a way to get rid of it. As you are contemplating whether you should burn it or just trash it, you catch a glimpse of the address. Are you kidding me?! The address is your own! You are the #4 ranked dad in the world.

And then you just stand there.
 Because you have no idea how to make yourself suddenly be #1. You have always thought you were a good father, but the top honor? Maybe you haven't been good enough. Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot?

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.

You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.  

If that loser is ranked so high up, your ranking will probably be in the hundreds of thousands. Discouraged, you walk towards your front door. The delivery box is still in your hands and you realize you need to find a way to get rid of it. As you are contemplating whether you should burn it or just trash it, you catch a glimpse of the address. Are you kidding me?! The address is your own! You are the #4 ranked dad in the world.

 Because you have no idea how to make yourself suddenly be #1. You have always thought you were a good father, but the top honor? Maybe you haven't been good enough. Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot?

You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming.

You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.

You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.

 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.

You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.

You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.

You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming. But you are afraid that someone might hear, so you run to the back yard and fling it as hard as you can over the fence into the pond that runs alongside the neighborhood.
