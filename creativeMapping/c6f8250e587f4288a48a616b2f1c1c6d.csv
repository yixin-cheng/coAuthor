Noram was a human who helped out bees to a great extent generations ago.    ""Noram cast a spell that helped the bees survive while the world around us crumbled"", the bee said.   ""He said that he and his descendants would need us in the future.  That is why we find his descendants every 50 years.""

""So, what do you want me to do?"", I said.
  ""Well, do you need us?"", the bee said.  ""I can't see why I would need you.  You wouldn't be a help in the problems that I have right now"", I said.  ""I see.  Well, we will be there when you are needed.  We will return in 50 years.  Bzzzbye to you!"", the bee said.

""No, your majesty.  Aslan isn't concerned with earth right now.  He has other matters to attend to.  The bees need your help"", the bee said.
