On your shoulder"", the bee said.  I looked down to see a bee in, what looked to be, a tiny red coat with golden buttons on it.  ""Did I just take a journey to Narnia right now?  Is Aslan going to pop out somewhere?"", I said.  

""No, your majesty.  Aslan isn't concerned with earth right now.  He has other matters to attend to.  The bees need your help"", the bee said.      ""What do you mean, the bees need my help?"", I said.  ""Well, every 50 years, the honey bees will seek out the descendent of King Noram.  Noram was a human who helped out bees to a great extent generations ago.    ""Noram cast a spell that helped the bees survive while the world around us crumbled"", the bee said.   ""He said that he and his descendants would need us in the future.  That is why we find his descendants every 50 years.""

""So, what do you want me to do?"", I said.
  ""Well, do you need us?"", the bee said.  ""I can't see why I would need you.  You wouldn't be a help in the problems that I have right now"", I said.  ""I see.  Well, we will be there when you are needed.  We will return in 50 years.  Bzzzbye to you!"", the bee said. 

""Yeah, sure.  Bzzzbye to you as well.  I guess"", I said.  I walked away from the bee and continued my walk through the park.  ""I need a strong cup of coffee after this one.""",user,39,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
