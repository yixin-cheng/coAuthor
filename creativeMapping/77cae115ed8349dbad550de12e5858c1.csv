The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends.

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie.

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway.

Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.

The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride.

The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride.

She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind o",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway.

The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by ho",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her.

She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her. He finds Soeurette and admonishes her, but then he realizes that she is being forced to do these things at the girls' home.

Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway.

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride.

Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie.

She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home.

She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her. He finds Soeurette and admonishes her, but then he realizes that she is being forced to do these things at the girls' home. Soeurette's father feels guilty that he abandoned his daughter and made her live with an abusive mother and her abusive boyfriend. So Soeurette's father says he will move back to where Soeurette lives and will take care of her. He says Soeurette can stay with him and she will leave the girls' home. Soeurette is absolutely thrilled by this and immediately accepts her dad's offer. The father makes sure Soeurette's mother will sign the papers allowing Soeurette to leave the girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her. He finds Soeurette and admonishes her, but then he realizes that she is being forced to do these things at the girls' home. Soeurette's father feels guilty that he abandoned his daughter and made her live with an abusive mother and her abusive boyfriend. So Soeurette's father says he will move back to where Soeurette lives and will take care of her. He says Soeurette can stay with him and she will leave the girls' home. Soeurette is absolutely thrilled by this and immediately accepts her dad's offer. The father makes sure Soeurette's mother will sign the papers allowing Soeurette to leave the girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage.

The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends.

As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her. He finds Soeurette and admonishes her, but then he realizes that she is being forced to do these things at the girls' home. Soeurette's father feels guilty that he abandoned his daughter and made her live with an abusive mother and her abusive boyfriend.

She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her. He finds Soeurette and admonishes her, but then he realizes that she is being forced to do these things at the girls' home. Soeurette's father feels guilty that he abandoned his daughter and made her live with an abusive mother and her abusive boyfriend.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often.

She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage.

For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her.

Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride.
