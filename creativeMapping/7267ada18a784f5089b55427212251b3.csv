She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever.

He decided to take her to a restaurant that he knew she loved. He picked her up in his car, and they drove to the restaurant.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever. 
When they arrived, he opened the door for her, and they walked into the restaurant.
 He had made reservations, so they were able to be seated immediately. The waiter took their drink orders, and they looked over the menu. 
The shapeshifter had been to this restaurant many times, so he knew exactly what to order.: eggplant parmesan with wedding soup. It would show the woman that while he indulged sometimes, he knew how to do it without going overboard. The woman asked if they could share their meals so that they could both eat a variety of food. 

he waiter came back with their drinks, and they ordered their meals.
 While they waited for their food, the shapeshifter told the woman how amazing she was and that the time they have spent dating had been the best time in his life. The woman was quite flattered and returned the sentiment. 
The waiter brought their food, and they began to eat.
 The shapeshifter cut a portion of his eggplant parmesan to give to the woman before he had eaten any of it, and she did the same with her meal. It was wonderful to experience the different flavors that they each enjoyed.

After they finished eating, the shapeshifter asked if the woman would like to go for a walk along the beach. She said yes, so they took a stroll in the sand. With the wind blowing gently against them, the shapeshifter stopped and knelt on one knee. The woman figured out immediately what was happening and smiled widely.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever. 
When they arrived, he opened the door for her, and they walked into the restaurant.
 He had made reservations, so they were able to be seated immediately. The waiter took their drink orders, and they looked over the menu. 
The shapeshifter had been to this restaurant many times, so he knew exactly what to order.: eggplant parmesan with wedding soup. It would show the woman that while he indulged sometimes, he knew how to do it without going overboard. The woman asked if they could share their meals so that they could both eat a variety of food. 

he waiter came back with their drinks, and they ordered their meals.
 While they waited for their food, the shapeshifter told the woman how amazing she was and that the time they have spent dating had been the best time in his life. The woman was quite flattered and returned the sentiment. 
The waiter brought their food, and they began to eat.
 The shapeshifter cut a portion of his eggplant parmesan to give to the woman before he had eaten any of it, and she did the same with her meal. It was wonderful to experience the different flavors that they each enjoyed.

After they finished eating, the shapeshifter asked if the woman would like to go for a walk along the beach. She said yes, so they took a stroll in the sand. With the wind blowing gently against them, the shapeshifter stopped and knelt on one knee. The woman figured out immediately what was happening and smiled widely.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever. 
When they arrived, he opened the door for her, and they walked into the restaurant.

The shapeshifter had been to this restaurant many times, so he knew exactly what to order.: eggplant parmesan with wedding soup. It would show the woman that while he indulged sometimes, he knew how to do it without going overboard. The woman asked if they could share their meals so that they could both eat a variety of food. 

he waiter came back with their drinks, and they ordered their meals.
 While they waited for their food, the shapeshifter told the woman how amazing she was and that the time they have spent dating had been the best time in his life. The woman was quite flattered and returned the sentiment. 
The waiter brought their food, and they began to eat.
 The shapeshifter cut a portion of his eggplant parmesan to give to the woman before he had eaten any of it, and she did the same with her meal. It was wonderful to experience the different flavors that they each enjoyed.

After they finished eating, the shapeshifter asked if the woman would like to go for a walk along the beach. She said yes, so they took a stroll in the sand. With the wind blowing gently against them, the shapeshifter stopped and knelt on one knee. The woman figured out immediately what was happening and smiled widely.

One day, the shapeshifter decided to put his plan into action. After all of his previous attempts at getting the woman to fall in love with him, he knew her likes and dislikes pretty well. He decided to take her to a restaurant that he knew she loved. He picked her up in his car, and they drove to the restaurant.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever.

The shapeshifter had been to this restaurant many times, so he knew exactly what to order.: eggplant parmesan with wedding soup.

 While they waited for their food, the shapeshifter told the woman how amazing she was and that the time they have spent dating had been the best time in his life. The woman was quite flattered and returned the sentiment. 
The waiter brought their food, and they began to eat.
 The shapeshifter cut a portion of his eggplant parmesan to give to the woman before he had eaten any of it, and she did the same with her meal. It was wonderful to experience the different flavors that they each enjoyed.

After they finished eating, the shapeshifter asked if the woman would like to go for a walk along the beach. She said yes, so they took a stroll in the sand. With the wind blowing gently against them, the shapeshifter stopped and knelt on one knee. The woman figured out immediately what was happening and smiled widely.

One day, the shapeshifter decided to put his plan into action. After all of his previous attempts at getting the woman to fall in love with him, he knew her likes and dislikes pretty well. He decided to take her to a restaurant that he knew she loved. He picked her up in his car, and they drove to the restaurant.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever.

After they finished eating, the shapeshifter asked if the woman would like to go for a walk along the beach. She said yes, so they took a stroll in the sand. With the wind blowing gently against them, the shapeshifter stopped and knelt on one knee. The woman figured out immediately what was happening and smiled widely.
