""They say they will do so."" said the bee. And I was so glad because I never had to worry about the bees stinging me again. But I still wondered why the bee thought I was his queen.

But at least I didn't have to worry about the bees stinging me. My allergy was gone and I could live a normal life.

He buzzed and said ""My queen, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen."" I was so flattered by this. I had no idea the bees thought I was beautiful enough to be their queen.
