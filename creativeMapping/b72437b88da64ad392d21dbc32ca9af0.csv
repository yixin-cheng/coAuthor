One day, the shapeshifter takes another form and falls for a new girl. He's decided that the girl he had pursued with so much vigor before, isn't worth his time, and he pours himself into a relationship with this new woman.   He's so consumed with his affection for this woman, he doesn't realize the girl he had originally dated, is now pursuing him as well. This confuses him,  she'd broken up with him time and time again, no matter what approach he tried, or what physical shape he took. Now that she's trying to get back with him, he doesn't know what to do. He loves the new woman in his life very much, but he'd put so much effort into trying to achieve a relationship with the prior girl,  that he has a hard time not responding to her advances. The new woman eventually finds out about this, but to his surprise she doesn't leave him. He's happy, but he's also confused as to why she hasn't run away after discovering this, and he asks her. 'It's a surprise,' she tells him.

Then, she leaves to go powder her nose.

Instead of her coming back, the new girlfriend arrives at the table.  She tells him that he has to choose between her, and the other woman, and he needs to do it now.  He can't decide, and she also leaves, and the other girl comes back. He has a moment of insight; this woman is also a shapeshifter, and she's been toying with him.
