He's so consumed with his affection for this woman, he doesn't realize the girl he had originally dated, is now pursuing him as well. This confuses him,  she'd broken up with him time and time again, no matter what approach he tried, or what physical shape he took. Now that she's trying to get back with him, he doesn't know what to do. He loves the new woman in his life very much, but he'd put so much effort into trying to achieve a relationship with the prior girl,  that he has a hard time not responding to her advances.

Instead of her coming back, the new girlfriend arrives at the table.  She tells him that he has to choose between her, and the other woman, and he needs to do it now.
