1211,text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. 

A dad named Tom was enjoying his morning coffee as he noticed this. He starts to get worried and calls his wife, who is in the kitchen. He shows her the mug. Just minutes earlier the mug said #1 Dad on it. Now it says #822922 Dad! It's so strange. He tries to call his friends, but they all say the same thing. They tell him that their mugs have changed too. 
Tom starts to panic.
 How could this be? It makes no sense! he thought. He starts to call the police to report this, but they say that they can't help him. He talks to his friend Rob and together they decide it's up them to solve the mystery of the changing mugs. 

They go to the store where they bought the mugs and talk to the manager. They ask the manager if he has heard why the mugs are all changing. He says he has no idea. So next they called the news station. They tell the news station about the mugs and they say they will send a reporter. 

The next day a reporter named Jane came to interview Tom and Rob about their changing mugs. ane was interviewing Tom when all of a sudden the mug changes again.
 The number went up one. Jane caught this on camera and was amazed. She said this was the biggest story she had ever covered. When the news showed this report people started calling the station with stories about their coffee mugs changing as well. 
The next day the news station had a special report oagain n the changing mugs.
 It seems that the CIA had already been looking into what was causing this phenomenon. They said that they had discovered that the mugs were changing because of a signal that was being sent from a satellite. An alien species was playing jokes on us by changing all the #1 Dad mugs in the world! Apparently, this was their idea of fun. But the Dads of the world didn't think so!",user,31,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
