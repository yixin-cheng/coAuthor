They tell him that their mugs have changed too. 
Tom starts to panic.
 How could this be? It makes no sense! he thought. He starts to call the police to report this, but they say that they can't help him. He talks to his friend Rob and together they decide it's up them to solve the mystery of the changing mugs.
