Completely shocked, I muttered, ""You... you... you're a bee?"" ""Why yes, Your Majesty. Name's Buzz, and I've been your personal bee for years."" the bee replied.

""Tell me what, exactly?"" I asked.

""That you're not allergic to bees, Your Majesty. Your mother lied to you. Which coincidently, is not really your mother."" revealed Buzz.

Speechless, all I can say is ""What?""

""Yes, your Majesty. You've been banished from the bee kingdom at an early age and you have been turned into a human as a punishment."" Buzz said.

""Why was I punished? What did I do?"" I asked.

""Well, you did something that was very... unbee-lievable."" said Buzz jokingly. ""When you were a kid, you were playing with your friends in the garden and you cut a bee hive to fall from a tree."" continued Buzz.

""I did that as a bee?"" I asked confusingly.
