This is the story of the rebirth of magic, and the beginning of a new age.
 The small human population were all huddled up under ground in a fallout shelter from the 1960's. Scared, starving and running out of water, the people thought for sure this was the end. But then, a small group of survivors found a strange glowing orb. It was located far underground, it appeared to be just chance that the orb was found directly next to last remaining humans, far underground. One of the young boys ran over to pick it up before he could be told not to and immediately his body started glowing blue. Everyone stepped back in awe and shock. The boy then said ""water"" and water started to pool up in an empty well next to him. He then sprayed some of the kids as a joke. Then the kids started glowing in different colors. All the prime colors and a few others that were not very familiar were also part of the group. The kids started producing food, drinks, entertainment and all kinds of other spoils that they had done with out for so long.

 The small human population were all huddled up under ground in a fallout shelter from the 1960's. Scared, starving and running out of water, the people thought for sure this was the end. But then, a small group of survivors found a strange glowing orb.
