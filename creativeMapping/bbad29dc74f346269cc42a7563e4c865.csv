Something peculiar starts to happen when the new version of us turned 80.  He started taking an experimental treatment that is supposed to increase his longevity.  It turns out it didn't simply increase his longevity.  He started to become immortal.

The time movies very quickly in the movie.  One minute the new version of us is six-years old.  The next moment he is 30.  We see him get married and have children.  We see him start to grow old.  Something peculiar starts to happen when the new version of us turned 80.  He started taking an experimental treatment that is supposed to increase his longevity.  It turns out it didn't simply increase his longevity.  He started to become immortal.

The other versions of me gasped in the theater when they realized what happened.  We were all expecting the new version of us to join us in the theater--eventually.

TThe movie starts off when the new version of me is six-years old.  I am at the age where I am starting to become aware of who I am.  I have learned the language of my parents.  My environment is starting to influence and mold me.  I am starting to think, “Who am I?” and my parents can already see that I am different from other children around me.  

The other variants of me in the theater cheer and boo at the choices the new version of us makes.  Some of the variants don't seem to care what choices the new version of us makes.  Internally, I can tell that life was very hard for those versions of me.   They have a defeated look to them.

The time movies very quickly in the movie.  One minute the new version of us is six-years old.  The next moment he is 30.  We see him get married and have children.  We see him start to grow old.  Something peculiar starts to happen when the new version of us turned 80.  He started taking an experimental treatment that is supposed to increase his longevity.  It turns out it didn't simply increase his longevity.  He started to become immortal.

The other versions of me gasped in the theater when they realized what happened.  We were all expecting the new version of us to join us in the theater--eventually.  We are all shocked when we realized that this was not the case.  In a means to celebrate our new versions triumph over death, he actually turned to the camera and winked at us.  The movie screen then faded to black.
