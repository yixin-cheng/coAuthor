The governments of the world are now faced with a difficult decision, do they tell the lost generations that they have the cure and have had it for 20 years now or do they let them slowly die off, riding the world of the old ways of thinking. The leaders who thought they were in total control of this information actually did not. The lost generations have found out that they have the cure and are now demanding it. One of the techs managed to sneak a vile out of the lab and sent it to the university to confirm its contents. The university confirms that the vile does indeed contain the cure. The news instantly goes viral and within two weeks the lost generations started recieving the new immortality drug. Over the course of a year, the old morphed back into their prime years and rejoined the world as productive, average, immortal citizens. ",user,5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
