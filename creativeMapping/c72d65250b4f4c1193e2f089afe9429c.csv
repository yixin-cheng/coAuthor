I Looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. 
""Excuse me,"" I said to him.
 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?
"" I said. ""Is it a world-between-worlds?"" 
""o,"" he said.
 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I followed her.

 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?

  I was in a place I didn't know, with people I didn't know. I didn't know what was going to happen to me.

I looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. 
""Excuse me,"" I said to him.
 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?

 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""Run to the forest, or I wi",user,38,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. 
""Excuse me,"" I said to him.
 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?

 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.

I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""Run to the forest, or they will take you!",user,38,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.

  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.

  I was in a place I didn't know, with people I didn't know. I didn't know what was going to happen to me.

I looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. 
""Excuse me,"" I said to him.
 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?
"" I said. ""Is it a world-between-worlds?"" 
""o,"" he said.
 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.

I looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. 
""Excuse me,"" I said to him.
 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?
"" I said. ""Is it a world-between-worlds?"" 
""o,"" he said.
 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.

I looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. 
""Excuse me,"" I said to him.
 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?
"" I said. ""Is it a world-between-worlds?"" 
""o,"" he said.
 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.

  I was in a place I didn't know, with people I didn't know. I didn't know what was going to happen to me.

I looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern.

You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.

 ""Can you tell me where I am?"" ""You're in the cinema,"" he said.
 ""You died, and now you're watching your next life."" ""But what is this place?
"" I said. ""Is it a world-between-worlds?"" 
""o,"" he said.
 ""This is the cinema.""  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. 
Excuse me,"" I said to her.
  ""Where am I?"" 
You're in the cinema,"" she said.
 

Nobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. ""Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape!"" 
I turned around, and saw a man in a suit, with a badge that said ""Security"". Frightened, I bolted to the door. The woman closed the the door, and leaned against it. ""Run!"", she said. ""run to the forest, or they will take you!"" I ran as fast as I could, and I didn't look back.


I made it to the edge of the forest, panting, and then collapsed, my head swimming with confusion and questions about what had just happened. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
