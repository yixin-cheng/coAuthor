Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today.

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table.

He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents?

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going. 


Once I arrived, the coordinates pointed me to an abandoned warehouse.

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going. 

nce I arrived, the coordinates pointed me to an abandoned warehouse.
 I took a step inside and there was a man in the shadows sitting at a desk. All he said was ""Welcome B",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
2087,text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going. 

nce I arrived, the coordinates pointed me to an abandoned warehouse.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing.
