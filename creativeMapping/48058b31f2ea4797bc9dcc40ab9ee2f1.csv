 The back room was filled with rows of what looked like dressing rooms, each with a curtain hanging on a rod. The clerk stopped in front of one of the curtains. It said ""#47"" on it. The clerk pulled the curtain aside and motioned for Murray to step inside. Murray pulled aside the curtain, and was astonished to find a small room completely filled with mugs. Each and every mug was different and unique. No two were alike. Every single mug said ""#47"" on it. Murray was amazed. He looked around the room, and then looked at the clerk. ""This is your number this year, Mr. Lowell, and you can choose from any of these."" 
""But, I want the same one I got last year.
 It said #1 Dad."" 
""I'm sorry, sir, but that mug is already registered to another customer.
"" 

Murray frowned. He looked again at the mugs. He noticed one that was multicolored and lit up. It said ""#47 Dad"" on it. It was like nothing he'd ever owned before. ""Time for something new. How much?""
