The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.   All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.

We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was ready as he ever could be.

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was ready as he ever could be.

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.   All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.   All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The co",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.

When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.   All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.

It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

When he arrived on earth, he was met by NASA.  They congratulated him for saving the earth.   Matt rep ",user,34,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.   All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.

He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

When he arrived on earth, he was met by NASA.  They congratulated him for saving the earth.   Matt replied, ""this wasn't the first  ",user,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.

We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.   All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.

It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

All we knew that it would be soon, and that they were coming to take over the world.  We decided to use Matt Damon as bait.  We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

When he arrived on earth, he was met by NASA.  They congratulated him for saving the earth.   Th Matt Damon then got a medal of honor.",user,34,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

The earth had been aware of an alien threat for the last 10 years.  We didn't know when the aliens would make their first move.

For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We had trained Matt Damon for years for this mission.  He knew the potential weak points of the aliens.  We also deciphered bits and pieces of the alien's language through our surveillance.  We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

When he arrived on earth, he was met by NASA.  They congratulated him for saving the earth.   The United States government gave Matt Damon a medal of honor for his work.  He is now filming an autobiographical movie about his space exploi",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
