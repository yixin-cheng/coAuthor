The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.

I'm in shock. How can this be? I get my calculator app on the screen doing math, realizing that JFK was born in 1917, so... Nah. It can't really be real. Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.
 Insisting Chet be on an extension, to get security insight, in real time.  I have a tracer also going, suggested by Chet.  So, it starts ringing. on the second ring, the voice seems shaky and somehow familiar. NO it COULD NOT be. Could it? ""Barak, it's Jack"". My reply is stunned silence, LONG silence. I finally summon up my inner strength and say simply. 'How'. ""Well, that's a long story"". I don't have time to get into it but we need to meet face to face.  I mention that I must include secret service for this to happen, I have too many active death threats to take this lightly. Jack says ""Sure, put Chet on"".

I'm in shock. How can this be? I get my calculator app on the screen doing math, realizing that JFK was born in 1917, so... Nah. It can't really be real. Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who?

The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me.

The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.

So, it starts ringing. on the second ring, the voice seems shaky and somehow familiar. NO it COULD NOT be. Could it? ""Barak, it's Jack"". My reply is stunned silence, LONG silence. I finally summon up my inner strength and say simply. 'How'. ""Well, that's a long story"". I don't have time to get into it but we need to meet face to face.  I mention that I must include secret service for this to happen, I have too many active death threats to take this lightly. Jack says ""Sure, put Chet on"".  

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me.

The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.
 Insisting Chet be on an extension, to get security insight, in real time.  I have a tracer also going, suggested by Chet.  So, it starts ringing. on the second ring, the voice seems shaky and somehow familiar. NO it COULD NOT be. Could it? ""Barak, it's Jack"". My reply is stunned silence, LONG silence. I finally summon up my inner strength and say simply. 'How'. ""Well, that's a long story"". I don't have time to get into it but we need to meet face to face.  I mention that I must include secret service for this to happen, I have too many active death threats to take this lightly. Jack says ""Sure, put Chet on"".  

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".  Then he hangs up. He tells me to get dressed, I begin doing that, putting on my khakis. He gets on the radio, held to his belt loop, calls in a couple of other agents, and coordinates with them.

I'm in shock. How can this be? I get my calculator app on the screen doing math, realizing that JFK was born in 1917, so... Nah. It can't really be real. Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I mention that I must include secret service for this to happen, I have too many active death threats to take this lightly. Jack says ""Sure, put Chet on"".  

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".

I'm in shock. How can this be? I get my calculator app on the screen doing math, realizing that JFK was born in 1917, so... Nah. It can't really be real. Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.

I finally summon up my inner strength and say simply. 'How'. ""Well, that's a long story"". I don't have time to get into it but we need to meet face to face.  I mention that I must include secret service for this to happen, I have too many active death threats to take this lightly. Jack says ""Sure, put Chet on"".  

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".  Then he hangs up. He tells me to get dressed, I begin doing that, putting on my khakis. He gets on the radio, held to his belt loop, calls in a couple of other agents, and coordinates with them.

Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me.

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".  Then he hangs up. He tells me to get dressed, I begin doing that, putting on my khakis. He gets on the radio, held to his belt loop, calls in a couple of other agents, and coordinates with them.

I'm in shock. How can this be? I get my calculator app on the screen doing math, realizing that JFK was born in 1917, so... Nah. It can't really be real. Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".

After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom.

Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".
