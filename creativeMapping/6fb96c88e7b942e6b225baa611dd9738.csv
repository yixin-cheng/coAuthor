Jak and his family are forced to live in a fallout shelter that they have converted into a home. Jak's father, who is the leader of the family, has taught Jak that the world outside is dangerous and that the only way to survive is to scavenge what they need from the ruins of the old world.

But Jak wants knowledge. He wants to know what happened to the world and why the United States was the only country to emerge from isolation. He has come across an ancient repository of information, something people once called the Library of Congress. Jak has learned how to use the library's computers to search for information, and he has been able to learn a great deal about the world.
