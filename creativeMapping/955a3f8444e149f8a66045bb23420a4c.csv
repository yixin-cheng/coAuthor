My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Yes I do, but why me?""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

She picks up, and immediately I tell her about the bee and if she knew about it.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

She picks up, and immediately I tell her about the bee and if she knew about it.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

She picks up, and immediately I tell her about the bee and if she knew about it.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

She picks up, and immediately I tell her about the bee and if she knew about it.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

She picks up, and immediately I tell her about the bee and if she knew about it.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders."" 

""Can you take me to see the queen? I have some questions.""

The bee shakes his little head ""I'm sorry but that is the one thing I cannot do. The queen mustn't be disturbed at any time."" The bee flies to my other shoulder. ""what do you want me to do now?"" He asks.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless.

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Nothing for now. But i can let you know when I think of something."" The bee salutes me again and flies into my shirt pocket and tells me he is with me if I need him.

Confused, I call my mom up on the phone. I needed to know if she knew about this and why she hid the secret from me.

She picks up, and immediately I tell her about the bee and if she knew about it. 

""Oh no."" She says somberly. ""We tried to hide this from you...the family secret. I had a lot of explain to you. Your real life is just beginning now."" She hangs up the phone. It is time for me to realize my destiny",user,54,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

At first, I think I am hearing things. But then I hear the buzz on my shoulder again, and a tiny voice asking for orders. I turn and look at the bee, he is staring back at me. I am speechless. My first instinct was to shoo the bee away because I am allergic, but I hesitate, and speak to bee, feeling silly. 

I ask the bee what he is doing here and what he means by 'your majesty'.
The bee responds, ""I am a bee, your majesty.
 Our queen has told the hive much about you. We have been trying to reach you for the past several years but someone keeps shooing us away and preventing us from reaching you. I am overjoyed to be here with you now your majesty. I am here to serve you.""

""But you're just a bee."" I say. ""How can you help me?""

""We bees may be small, but we are powerful when we work together. Why don't you give it a shot? Ask me for something.""

I think for a bit and then I decide to test it out. I ask the bee to get me a beer.

""At once."" the bee responds and then zips away. I see him come back with a small swarm of bees that approach the fridge. They form a hand and pull open fridge, pick up a can of beer, open it, and bring it back to me. I hear all of the voices at once say in unison ""Here you are your majesty.""

I am stunned. I drink the beer and thank the bees. They salute me all at once and the swarm flies away, leaving that one bee from before behind who lands on my shoulder.

""Do you believe me now?""

""Yes I do, but why me?""

""I don't know your majesty, I just follow my orders.""
