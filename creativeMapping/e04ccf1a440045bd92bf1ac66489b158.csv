1619,text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. It's a bit of a shock to the Dads who now find out that they are at the bottom of the barrel. They decide to start a support group to cope with it. It's a pitiful affair as they each week go to the meetings, feeling sorry for themselves. One Dad, however, is determined to make it better for all the Dads. He says that they can just go and change the number on their mugs. Then their families and friends will think they aren't the worst dads anymore. 
The other Dads cheer, get up, and begin to leave the meeting.
 They go home and use pens to change the number on their mugs. The next week, they all go to the support group. They share their experiences of what has happened since. The first Dad says he went home and changed the number on the mug. He says that it resulted in his wife being impressed. She thought he must have been trying harder so he was thrilled. He got recognition without changing anything. 

One dad suggested that they just try and be better fathers and they wouldn't have to lie like this. All of the dads laughed and said that was a good joke. They then went back to stories of how changing the numbers had been such a success. 

They then started to get greedy. They began changing the numbers over and over, giving themselves a higher ranking. They talked about how much more praise and attention they had gotten from their families. It was becoming an addiction. Finally, one week they realize they had all now ranked themselves as the #1 dad. They couldn't let their families see another dad's mug. Then the praise they've been getting would stop. They decide the only option is for each of them to all go live in the woods with their families, isolated from everyone. 

They disband as a group and all go live as hermits with their families. The families are miserable and the praise is gone, but they are happy at least keeping the #1 rating. No one can take that awa",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
