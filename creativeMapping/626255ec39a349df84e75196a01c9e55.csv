The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""There are so many pigs to eat, and they make it so easy!"" But the wolf didn't know about uranium. 

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. 
Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!""

And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium.""",user,32,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. 
Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wail",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""There are so many pigs to eat, and they make it so easy!"" But the wolf didn't know about uranium. 

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. 
Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. 
Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. 
Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""There are so many pigs to eat, and they make it so easy!"" But the wolf didn't know about uranium. 

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. 
Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently.

 Come in, come in!"" And the wolf was like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in.

So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently.

 Come in, come in!"" The wolf chomped , ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good. 

The little pig dialed his phone. ""Yes, Hello EPA? There is some uncontained nuclear waste in this area. You might want to dispose of it!""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""There are so many pigs to eat, and they make it so easy!"" But the wolf didn't know about uranium. 

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" The wolf drool, ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good.

So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" The wolf drooled hungerly. ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?"" And the robot pigs were like, ""We're going to bring it right out."" The wolf snarled ""Okay, but I'm really hungry."" The robots quickly replied, ""We'll be right back!"" 

But something was happening to the wolf! The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, ""What's happening to me? I'm melting!"" ""Oh, that's just the uranium."" said the robot pigs.  ""Aaaaahhhhhh"" wailed the wolf, as he was changed into a quivering pile of jelly-like good. 

The little pig dialed his phone. ""Yes, Hello EPA? There is some uncontained nuclear waste in this area. You might want to dispose of it!""
