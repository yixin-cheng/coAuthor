The news was everywhere.

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliends didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!

They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliends didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smi

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!

They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliens didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon.

 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet.

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliens didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smiled and nodded even though he didn't understand.

 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!
The humans, meanwhile, had been working on a plan.
 The assembled their fleet and launched it into space. They were going to get Matt Damon back, and they were going to do it in style! They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliens didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smiled and nodded even though he didn't understand. And so the aliens thought he was ok with coming with them, and just walked him on board and left. 
The aliens were really sorry, and they were happy to let Matt Damon go.

The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon.

There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smiled and nodded even though he didn't understand. And so the aliens thought he was ok with coming with them, and just walked him on board and left. 
The aliens were really sorry, and they were happy to let Matt Damon go.

 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!
The humans, meanwhile, had been working on a plan.
 The assembled their fleet and launched it into space. They were going to get Matt Damon back, and they were going to do it in style! They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliens didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smiled and nodded even though he didn't understand. And so the aliens thought he was ok with coming with them, and just walked him on board and left. 
The aliens were really sorry, and they were happy to let Matt Damon go.

The world was in an uproar. Matt Damon was missing. And, according to a few trustworthy sources, he had been taken by aliens. 
The news was everywhere.
 Aliens would have been shocking enough, but taking Matt Damon was inconceivable. Who would kidnap such a good person?!?  
The aliens had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!

They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliens didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smiled and nodded even though he didn't understand. And so the aliens thought he was ok with coming with them, and just walked him on board and left. 
The aliens were really sorry, and they were happy to let Matt Damon go.
