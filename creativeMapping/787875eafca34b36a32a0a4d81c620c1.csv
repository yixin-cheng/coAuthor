The magic of the old gods is returning.
 In order to use it, however, the humans must humble themselves. Mana only flows through those who understand the nature of life: humans, animals, plants, and elements all must work together to take care of Earth. The humans visit the old libraries in Greece in order to learn more about Mana.
