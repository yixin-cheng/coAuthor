 We had struggled during that time from the lack of trading and having access to foreign technologies. We had to rebuild everything. We just weren't in the best situation to do so.

The only problem was that the United States was in no shape to do so.
 We had struggled during that time from the lack of trading and having access to foreign technologies. We had to rebuild everything. We just weren't in the best situation to do so. 

We asked for volunteers who would go to different areas of the world to start helping rebuild and to help survivors. Many volunteered to go to what are considered nicer countries. Few volunteered for the already poverty stricken areas. 

Once people set up around the world, it started to rebuild. We were able to get the world back up and running, but it was a very slow process. There was one thing we didn't expect though. The very people who we sent over ended up siding with the local inhabitants. This ended up causing yet another world war. It went on and many of the already limited population died.
