 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place.

Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.

 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship.

Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed.

Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him.

 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.

They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him.

 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.

Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed.

Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism.

When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism.

He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first.

Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.
