 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people.

As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets. The leader responded by sending in the military to break up the protests.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets. The leader responded by sending in the military to break up the protests.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets. The leader responded by sending in the military to break up the protests.

After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets. The leader responded by sending in the military to break up the protests.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst.

His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world.

His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets.

 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets. The leader responded by sending in the military to break up the protests.

Many people were killed. The chaos played out on the world stage. The rest of the world was horrified. The people of the United States were wrong. The rest of the world did not come to their aid.
