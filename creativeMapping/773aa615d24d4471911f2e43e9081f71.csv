I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world.

If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own dea

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to ge

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy.""

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy.""

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

You explain to JFK that while you appreciate the offer, you feel it is too risky. Since you are also a previous President, you'd have to fly with the Secret Servic

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous Preside",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. Th",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well an",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy.""

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possib",user,35,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy.""

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tel",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to reach",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to keep in touch and he t",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy.""

If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to keep in touch and he tells you he will. You never hear from",user,37,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to keep in touch and he tells you he will. You never hear from JFK again an",user,37,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to keep in touch and he tells you he will.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to keep in touch and he tells you he will.
