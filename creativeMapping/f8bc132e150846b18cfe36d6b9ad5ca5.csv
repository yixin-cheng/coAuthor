The current president of the United States is shell shocked. He sees that the world is completely different. China has created war androids that have taken over much of the world. They are a technological nightmare. The world looks like a dystopian horror story. Taiwan, Japan, Africa, and Europe are now under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
The United States has to stop the Chinese military, but they are no match for China’s war machines.

The civilian casualties are enormous, but not as enormous as they would have been had the Chinese Communist Party been allowed to continue its world domination.
