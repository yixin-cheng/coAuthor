I quickly scanned the mug to see if my name was on the list. I was not technically a dad, but still a step-dad. I figured i would still be on the list since i did all i could do to raise the kids in the best way i knew how. I wasnt sure if i was dreaming or if this was real, however in the moment all i cared about was looking at the list on my mug. I didnt even take a sip of the coffee. My mouth was open and my eyes were focused on the mug.  thought maybe i should make sure my eyes werent playing tricks on me.
