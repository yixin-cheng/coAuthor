It had moved on without them, and while the other nations didn't mind the US being back, they didn't really care either way to be honest.

The call over, the President sat back in his chair. ""Well, that was a real kick in the teeth."" He called in his cabinet, and they discussed what to do next, what they should tell the citizens.

""Mr. President, we have a call for you from the Prime Minister of England.""
 The President of the US answered, and the conversation that followed devastated him. He learned just how far behind they were, just how little they understood of the current situation, and worst of all, just how little the US mattered in the world now. It had moved on without them, and while the other nations didn't mind the US being back, they didn't really care either way to be honest.

The call over, the President sat back in his chair. ""Well, that was a real kick in the teeth."" He called in his cabinet, and they discussed what to do next, what they should tell the citizens. 
The next day, the President addressed the nation.
