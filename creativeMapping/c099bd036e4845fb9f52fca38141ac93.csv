The President of France was speaking to the Prime Minister of England via video chat. ""Well,"" President Hillar started, ""What do you think we should do about them. It's rather sad really.""

PM Frand responded ""Yes, sad indeed. The state of the country..a disappointment even. Based on the old stories, would have thought they would have held up better. But, I suppose we should do something about them.""

""Of course, it's not like we didn't try to contact them and let them know the plan was off. I distinctly remember the news stories from 40 years ago when I was a child. How all of the larger nations, former allies and former enemies reached out in every way possible. Stubborn Americans just wouldn't listen.""

He was told it was much better than the old tech, and that stung. What was to come stung even more. 
""Mr. President, we have a call for you from the Prime Minister of England.""
 The President of the US answered, and the conversation that followed devastated him. He learned just how far behind they were, just how little they understood of the current situation, and worst of all, just how little the US mattered in the world now. It had moved on without them, and while the other nations didn't mind the US being back, they didn't really care either way to be honest.

The call over, the President sat back in his chair. ""Well, that was a real kick in the teeth."" He called in his cabinet, and they discussed what to do next, what they should tell the citizens. 
The next day, the President addressed the nation.

The call over, the President sat back in his chair. ""Well, that was a real kick in the teeth."" He called in his cabinet, and they discussed what to do next, what they should tell the citizens.

The President of France was speaking to the Prime Minister of England via video chat. ""Well,"" President Hillar started, ""What do you think we should do about them. It's rather sad really.""

PM Frand responded ""Yes, sad indeed. The state of the country..a disappointment even. Based on the old stories, would have thought they would have held up better. But, I suppose we should do something about them.""

""Of course, it's not like we didn't try to contact them and let them know the plan was off. I distinctly remember the news stories from 40 years ago when I was a child. How all of the larger nations, former allies and former enemies reached out in every way possible. Stubborn Americans just wouldn't listen."" The President of France nodded along to the PM's statement.
The President of the United States was sitting in his office, reading a book. when the technicians brought in the device. A gift from England to the US ""our old friends"" according the the communication. It was a communication device, one that allowed video calls with crystal clarity. He was told it was much better than the old tech, and that stung. What was to come stung even more. 
""Mr. President, we have a call for you from the Prime Minister of England.""
 The President of the US answered, and the conversation that followed devastated him. He learned just how far behind they were, just how little they understood of the current situation, and worst of all, just how little the US mattered in the world now. It had moved on without them, and while the other nations didn't mind the US being back, they didn't really care either way to be honest.

The call over, the President sat back in his chair. ""Well, that was a real kick in the teeth."" He called in his cabinet, and they discussed what to do next, what they should tell the citizens. 
The next day, the President addressed the nation.
 ""Fellow Americans, I have some news that may be hard to hear. But I believe you are ready for it...""
