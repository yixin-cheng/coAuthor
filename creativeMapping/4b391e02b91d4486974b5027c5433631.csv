Marybeth says that Joe was also always drunk and probably crashed his car while driving while intoxicated.

But here's the thing. Any mugs that owners were already dead are now blank. Joe's mug isn't blank at all. What's interesting, as Detective Tapp has figured out, ""he's number one!"" was written on it. ""So Joe must still be alive"" Tapp notes, and he runs out of the room to look for him.

Detective David Tapp, who is investigating the disappearance of Marybeth's husband, Joe, has a flashback to his own childhood. It was Tapp's own dad, who was drunk, that was responsible for an accident that left the boy with a facial scar. He wonders what is the old man's mug says. He bets it's very low in the rankings. Marybeth says that Joe was also always drunk and probably crashed his car while driving while intoxicated.

But here's the thing. Any mugs that owners were already dead are now blank. Joe's mug isn't blank at all. What's interesting, as Detective Tapp has figured out, ""he's number one!"" was written on it. ""So Joe must still be alive"" Tapp notes, and he runs out of the room to look for him.

""But how can be a drunk husband be the number 1 dad?"" Detective Tapp contemplated. ""It just doesn't make sense. How are the rankings decided?"" There were thoughts running on Detective Tapp's mind as he follows on a clue on Joe's last whereabouts.

He stops by the local bar as there were multiple witnesses to Joe's last night before he disappeared. He spoke with a woman who recognized Joe from the picture. ""He was in here last night,"" she said, ""He was drinking way too much, very drunk."" said the woman.

""Did he say where he's going to go?"" Detective Tapp asked. 

""He was talking about his wife and kids,"" the woman said. ""He said that his wife was always complaining about how much he worked, and it made him stressed.""

Detective David Tapp, who is investigating the disappearance of Marybeth's husband, Joe, has a flashback to his own childhood. It was Tapp's own dad, who was drunk, that was responsible for an accident that left the boy with a facial scar. He wonders what is the old man's mug says. He bets it's very low in the rankings. Marybeth says that Joe was also always drunk and probably crashed his car while driving while intoxicated.

But here's the thing. Any mugs that owners were already dead are now blank. Joe's mug isn't blank at all. What's interesting, as Detective Tapp has figured out, ""he's number one!"" was written on it. ""So Joe must still be alive"" Tapp notes, and he runs out of the room to look for him.

""But how can be a drunk husband be the number 1 dad?"" Detective Tapp contemplated. ""It just doesn't make sense. How are the rankings decided?"" There were thoughts running on Detective Tapp's mind as he follows on a clue on Joe's last whereabouts.

He stops by the local bar as there were multiple witnesses to Joe's last night before he disappeared. He spoke with a woman who recognized Joe from the picture. ""He was in here last night,"" she said, ""He was drinking way too much, very drunk."" said the woman.

""Did he say where he's going to go?"" Detective Tapp asked. 

""He was talking about his wife and kids,"" the woman said. ""He said that his wife was always complaining about how much he worked, and it made him stressed.""

Detective Tapp leaves the bar and gets a call from his partner. His partner said, ""We found Joe's car on the highway."" Fearing for the worst, Detective Tapp knew that there must be something wrong. He arrived to the scene and he saw Joe, alive, with a blanket over him. It turned out that Joe had saved a child from a car accident, and now he is the number 1 dad.

Detective David Tapp, who is investigating the disappearance of Marybeth's husband, Joe, has a flashback to his own childhood.
