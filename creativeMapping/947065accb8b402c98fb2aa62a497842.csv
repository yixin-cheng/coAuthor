I should let you know, you really are not allergic to bees at all. That is a lie everyone has told you to keep you from the truth of who you really are your highness."" 

You ask the bee what the truth is, and he says ""You are the last of the royal family, and you are the queen bee of all the hives around here. We are in a honey draught at the moment. That's why I am here, to know what we should do."" 

You are shocked, and ask the bee if he is sure. ""Yes, very sure."" he says. ""All the humans are eating all of our honey, and we can do little to stop them because if we sting them we die."" 

You ask the bee what you should do, and he says ""You must go to the humans and ask them to stop eating all of honey, that might help."" So you instruct the bee to tell all the workers to continue their work to make honey, and you will take care of the human problem.
You go to the humans and ask them to stop eating all the honey.
 They only laugh at you. So the following day you talked your mother, the Queen, to pass a law to outlaw the consumption of honey. So she did. You noticed almost right away it had a positive outcome for all the bees.

You look around to hear where the voice came from. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a thumb, sitting on your shoulder. You start to panic, thinking you are about to be stung, and maybe die, but the bee quickly says ""Don't worry, your majesty, I'm not going to sting you. I'm here to see if I can help you."" 

You are still a little apprehensive, but you ask the bee what he can do to help you. The bee looks at you and says ""I see you are still afraid.
