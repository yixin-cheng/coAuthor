The common theme was that all of the people looking similar to me were athletic, the uncommon theme were the accents of speech, the personalities, and the life experiences.

I looked all around. All i see is me. Not like I am looking the mirror or looking at my reflection in the water, but literally a bunch of me. It was a little wierd since it was a bunch of naked me's, however still very interesting. All of the different people who looked identical to me were people who reincarnated as me. It was funny becuase all though we all looked similar, we had different intricate changes from the time period we were living in. For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash. The me that lived in the early 1900's was actually a professional and olympic athlete. The common theme was that all of the people looking similar to me were athletic, the uncommon theme were the accents of speech, the personalities, and the life experiences.

All i wanted to do was sit down and ask everyone about their lives to compare and contrast experiences but it was too late. The life of another reincarnation had begun. The big screen started to zoom in from my vision, and we all had a first person point of view of the baby coming out of the mothers womb. Although we could no longer see one another in the cinema, we could still hear one another, and feel one another if we put our arms out. I asked everyone what was going on, and i heard a voice similar to mine respond that this was the reincarnation of us. Everyone was very excited to see at how everything panned out, and to see if there were any new talents that the reincarnation had.  fter watching for a period of time, the screen zoomed out to a more broad view.

I looked all around. All i see is me. Not like I am looking the mirror or looking at my reflection in the water, but literally a bunch of me. It was a little wierd since it was a bunch of naked me's, however still very interesting. All of the different people who looked identical to me were people who reincarnated as me. It was funny becuase all though we all looked similar, we had different intricate changes from the time period we were living in. For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash. The me that lived in the early 1900's was actually a professional and olympic athlete.

I looked all around. All i see is me. Not like I am looking the mirror or looking at my reflection in the water, but literally a bunch of me. It was a little wierd since it was a bunch of naked me's, however still very interesting. All of the different people who looked identical to me were people who reincarnated as me. It was funny becuase all though we all looked similar, we had different intricate changes from the time period we were living in. For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash. The me that lived in the early 1900's was actually a professional and olympic athlete. The common theme was that all of the people looking similar to me were athletic, the uncommon theme were the accents of speech, the personalities, and the life experiences.

I asked everyone what was going on, and i heard a voice similar to mine respond that this was the reincarnation of us. Everyone was very excited to see at how everything panned out, and to see if there were any new talents that the reincarnation had.  fter watching for a period of time, the screen zoomed out to a more broad view.

I looked all around. All i see is me. Not like I am looking the mirror or looking at my reflection in the water, but literally a bunch of me. It was a little wierd since it was a bunch of naked me's, however still very interesting. All of the different people who looked identical to me were people who reincarnated as me. It was funny becuase all though we all looked similar, we had different intricate changes from the time period we were living in. For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash. The me that lived in the early 1900's was actually a professional and olympic athlete. The common theme was that all of the people looking similar to me were athletic, the uncommon theme were the accents of speech, the personalities, and the life experiences.

I asked everyone what was going on, and i heard a voice similar to mine respond that this was the reincarnation of us.

 I was able to see my previous reincarnations again. This time everyone had a movie screen on their head, and i was able to see previous life experiences. I did not know why this was happening, and it made me both very interested, but also afraid. After a while of seeing the different life experiences, i was able to see my current reincarnation from the broad view, and it looked like everyone elses individual cinema's had paused.

Although we could no longer see one another in the cinema, we could still hear one another, and feel one another if we put our arms out. I asked everyone what was going on, and i heard a voice similar to mine respond that this was the reincarnation of us. Everyone was very excited to see at how everything panned out, and to see if there were any new talents that the reincarnation had.  fter watching for a period of time, the screen zoomed out to a more broad view.
 I was able to see my previous reincarnations again. This time everyone had a movie screen on their head, and i was able to see previous life experiences. I did not know why this was happening, and it made me both very interested, but also afraid. After a while of seeing the different life experiences, i was able to see my current reincarnation from the broad view, and it looked like everyone elses individual cinema's had paused. We all observed our current reincarnation but were yet to have any control.

It was funny becuase all though we all looked similar, we had different intricate changes from the time period we were living in. For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash.

We all observed our current reincarnation but were yet to have any control. By this time it had already been two years into the current reincarnations life, all of which seemed to feel like 2 minutes for me. The reincarnation could walk now, and was even saying words. Just as i noticed that the reincarnation was speaking to the parents, my vision started to blurr and fade to black. I was now alone in my thoughts.",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
