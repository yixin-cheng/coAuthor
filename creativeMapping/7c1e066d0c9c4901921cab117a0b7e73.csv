This particular night, Priscilla was eating dinner alone in a busy restaurant near the bar. She was sitting at a table in the corner of a restaurant, and she was looking around the room, hoping to catch the eye of someone who would be willing to take her home for the night.  Priscilla wanted someone to ask her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?'

She had been sitting there for a while, and she was beginning to get bored. She was about to give up, when she saw a man walk into the restaurant. He was tall, with dark hair and blue eyes. He was wearing a suit, and he looked like he had money. Priscilla smiled to herself, and she began to think that maybe this night wasn't going to be a total waste after all.

Th man walked into the restaurant, and he looked around.
  His eyes met hers. Priscilla didn't know this, but Hugh was her previous boyfriend, shapeshifted into a new form. He had been in love with her for a long time, and he had been trying to win her heart for years. He had been in love with her for so long, he had forgotten what he looked like.  He had tried so many forms, trying in vain to win her over. He had been a soldier, a doctor, a lawyer, a fireman, and even a priest. Nothing had worked.
Priscilla smiled at him, and he walked over to her table.
 He sat down across from her, and he asked her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?"" 
Priscilla smiled at him, and she said, ""I'm not eating alone.
 You're here with me."" 
Hugh smiled at her, and he said, ""I'm ""..Ronnie,"" He lied. I'm Priscilla,"" she said.
 ""Would you like to have dinner with me?"" he asked. ""I'd love to,"" she said. 

Suddenly all the lights in the restaurant went out. In the darkness, someone touched Hugh's arm, and pulled him close. ""She will NEVER love you, she is only using you,"" the voice said. ""You can change yourself all you want, but it won't matter. She is the problem."" 
HThe lights went back on, and Hugh stood up, confused. ""

Priscilla was superficial. She was a girl who was only interested in a man's looks and money. She had dated many men, but none of them had been able to hold her interest for more than a few weeks. She was always looking for the next best thing, and she didn't care who she hurt in the process.

This particular night, Priscilla was eating dinner alone in a busy restaurant near the bar. She was sitting at a table in the corner of a restaurant, and she was looking around the room, hoping to catch the eye of someone who would be willing to take her home for the night.  Priscilla wanted someone to ask her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?'

She had been sitting there for a while, and she was beginning to get bored. She was about to give up, when she saw a man walk into the restaurant. He was tall, with dark hair and blue eyes.

He had tried so many forms, trying in vain to win her over. He had been a soldier, a doctor, a lawyer, a fireman, and even a priest. Nothing had worked.

This particular night, Priscilla was eating dinner alone in a busy restaurant near the bar. She was sitting at a table in the corner of a restaurant, and she was looking around the room, hoping to catch the eye of someone who would be willing to take her home for the night.  Priscilla wanted someone to ask her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?'

She had been sitting there for a while, and she was beginning to get bored. She was about to give up, when she saw a man walk into the restaurant. He was tall, with dark hair and blue eyes.

 ""Would you like to have dinner with me?"" he asked. ""I'd love to,"" she said. 

Suddenly all the lights in the restaurant went out. In the darkness, someone touched Hugh's arm, and pulled him close. ""She will NEVER love you, she is only using you,"" the voice said. ""You can change yourself all you want, but it won't matter. She, and she alone is the problem.""

This particular night, Priscilla was eating dinner alone in a busy restaurant near the bar. She was sitting at a table in the corner of a restaurant, and she was looking around the room, hoping to catch the eye of someone who would be willing to take her home for the night.  Priscilla wanted someone to ask her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?'

She had been sitting there for a while, and she was beginning to get bored. She was about to give up, when she saw a man walk into the restaurant. He was tall, with dark hair and blue eyes. He was wearing a suit, and he looked like he had money. Priscilla smiled to herself, and she began to think that maybe this night wasn't going to be a total waste after all.

 ""Would you like to have dinner with me?"" he asked. ""I'd love to,"" she said. 

Suddenly all the lights in the restaurant went out. In the darkness, someone touched Hugh's arm, and pulled him close. ""She will NEVER love you, she is only using you,"" the voice said. ""You can change yourself all you want, but it won't matter. She, and she alone is the problem.""

He had tried so many forms, trying in vain to win her over. He had been a soldier, a doctor, a lawyer, a fireman, and even a priest. Nothing had worked.

Priscilla smiled at him, and he walked over to her table.
 He sat down across from her, and he asked her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?""

Hugh smiled at her, and he said, ""I'm ""..Ronnie,"" He lied. I'm Priscilla,"" she said.
 ""Would you like to have dinner with me?"" he asked. ""I'd love to,"" she said. 

Suddenly all the lights in the restaurant went out. In the darkness, someone touched Hugh's arm, and pulled him close. ""She will NEVER love you, she is only using you,"" the voice said. ""You can change yourself all you want, but it won't matter. She, and she alone is the problem."" 
HThe lights went back on, and Hugh stood up ""Sorry"", he said. ""I, uh, just had some bad news. I have to go.""  And with that, he left a very confused Priscilla sitting, again, by herself, just as she deserved. ",user,26,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
