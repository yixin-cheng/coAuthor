 So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me ""Are you Barack Obama?"" and I replied ""Yeah, why?"" and they said, ""Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today."" I said, ""Ok?"". 
That day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits.
 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.

I thought to myself ""Uh what? I thought JFK was dead"" and I brushed it off as a prank. 
I woke up the next morning and found ANOTHER letter from JFK, this time with a phone number on it.
 I looked at the number, and my jaw dropped. t was the White House.
 So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me ""Are you Barack Obama?"" and I replied ""Yeah, why?"" and they said, ""Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today."" I said, ""Ok?"". 
That day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits.
 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.
 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day.

 So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me ""Are you Barack Obama?"" and I replied ""Yeah, why?"" and they said, ""Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today."" I said, ""Ok?"". 
That day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits.
 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.
 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day.

I thought to myself ""Uh what? I thought JFK was dead"" and I brushed it off as a prank.

 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.

 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.
 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day.

 So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me ""Are you Barack Obama?"" and I replied ""Yeah, why?"" and they said, ""Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today."" I said, ""Ok?"". 
That day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits.
 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.
 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day. 
So I said, ""Ok...I'll do it.""
 So I did it. I went back in time and stopped jfk from dying. I told him to not go to Dallas. He said, ""Ok, I won't go to Dallas."" I said ""Promise?"" and he said, ""I promise"" and smiled.

 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day. 
So I said, ""Ok...I'll do it.""

I thought to myself ""Uh what? I thought JFK was dead"" and I brushed it off as a prank.

I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine.

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.

I woke up the next morning and found ANOTHER letter from JFK, this time with a phone number on it.
 I looked at the number, and my jaw dropped. t was the White House.
 So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me ""Are you Barack Obama?"" and I replied ""Yeah, why?"" and they said, ""Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today."" I said, ""Ok?"". 
That day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits.
 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.
 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day. 
So I said, ""Ok...I'll do it.""
 So I did it. I went back in time and stopped jfk from dying. I told him to not go to Dallas. He said, ""Ok, I won't go to Dallas."" I said ""Promise?"" and he said, ""I promise"" and smiled. 

I then traveled back to the present time and told the guys in suits that the job was completed. They were happy and they gave me a medal and $100,000.",api,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I thought to myself ""Uh what? I thought JFK was dead"" and I brushed it off as a prank. 
I woke up the next morning and found ANOTHER letter from JFK, this time with a phone number on it.
 I looked at the number, and my jaw dropped. t was the White House.
 So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me ""Are you Barack Obama?"" and I replied ""Yeah, why?"" and they said, ""Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today."" I said, ""Ok?"". 
That day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits.
 They sat me down and said, ""Mr. Obama, we have a problem."" I said, ""What kind of problem?"" and they told me about the time machine. I said, ""What time machine?"" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. 

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.
 So I said, ""What exactly do you want me to do?"" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas. Warn him about what's to come and make sure that he will not die that fateful day. 
So I said, ""Ok...I'll do it.""
 So I did it. I went back in time and stopped jfk from dying. I told him to not go to Dallas. He said, ""Ok, I won't go to Dallas."" I said ""Promise?"" and he said, ""I promise"" and smiled.
