JFK used a stunt double and effects to make it look real. You sit there and tell JFK you want proof. He sends you a picture of his license as well as pictures from his past in his wallet. He also shows you his new license that has a fake name on it as well.

You sit there shocked and have no idea how to react. JFK tells you that he has a job for you and that you will be paid handsomely. He tells you to pack your bags and that you will be picked up in a few hours.

A few hours later you are picked up and are going to a unknown destination. You sit in the car and the man driving tells you that you will be working with JFK. You ask him what the job is and he tells you that you will be working with JFK to help him take down the Illuminati.

You ask JFK what the issue with the Illuminati is. He tells you that they are a group of people who control the world and have been doing so for centuries. They are a group of people who control the world's money supply and are very rich. 
He tells you that he wants to take them down and that he needs your help.
 You tell JFK that you would love to help but don't know where to start. JFK tells you that he has a plan and that he will explain it to you on the way.

You're shocked. This has to be a joke. JFK has been dead for ages. There is even a video of him getting shot in the head. Surely you are just being trolled by someone. At the end of the day, your curiosity gets the best of you.

You call the number and a man picks up. You tell him that you're Barack Obama and got the letter that was sent and marked by a JFK. The man tells you to hold on and transfers you to another line.

You hear a man pick up and he claims that he is John F. Kennedy. You tell him that's impossible and that JFK has been dead for decades. He explains that he has been alive the entire time and wanted to get out of the limelight. The entire assassination was staged similar to a movie.

JFK used a stunt double and effects to make it look real. You sit there and tell JFK you want proof. He sends you a picture of his license as well as pictures from his past in his wallet. He also shows you his new license that has a fake name on it as well.

You sit there shocked and have no idea how to react. JFK tells you that he has a job for you and that you will be paid handsomely. He tells you to pack your bags and that you will be picked up in a few hours.

A few hours later you are picked up and are going to a unknown destination. You sit in the car and the man driving tells you that you will be working with JFK. You ask him what the job is and he tells you that you will be working with JFK to help him take down the Illuminati.

You ask JFK what the issue with the Illuminati is. He tells you that they are a group of people who control the world and have been doing so for centuries. They are a group of people who control the world's money supply and are very rich. 
He tells you that he wants to take them down and that he needs your help.
 You tell JFK that you would love to help but don't know where to start. JFK tells you that he has a plan and that he will explain it to you on the way. He explains that you that he is going to infiltrate the Illumanti and destroy them from the inside. His new alias is the 3rd richest person in the world.
