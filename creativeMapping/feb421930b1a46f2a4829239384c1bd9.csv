I'm not sure where I stand on the idea of immortality. Immortality seems like a really cool idea and all but sometimes you just don't want to live anymore. I mean, think about it, if people don't die, then what's the point of living forever?. And also, people would get pretty bored just sitting around, and then they probably would just go crazy.

You can do A LOT of things if you never die. You could visit every single continent if you wanted, and you'll be able to experience a lot of things for the first time.

I'm not sure where I stand on the idea of immortality. Immortality seems like a really cool idea and all but sometimes you just don't want to live anymore. I mean, think about it, if people don't die, then what's the point of living forever?. And also, people would get pretty bored just sitting around, and then they probably would just go crazy. I mean living forever sounds scary. 

Yeah, maybe it's ok if you need to see someone for one last time knowing you're not going to die but knowing that you're not going to die and knowing that you'll never die is just too much.

On the bright side, the benefits of not dying would include being able to do things you've never done before such as travel to places you've never been or go swimming on the ocean floor for the first time. You can do A LOT of things if you never die. You could visit every single continent if you wanted, and you'll be able to experience a lot of things for the first time.

So there are some benefits to not dying but let's be real most people would want to die at some point. I mean what else is there to do if you've already traveled the world, swam up the highest mountain, and gone into space. What are you living for if you've already done everything.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

I'm not sure where I stand on the idea of immortality. Immortality seems like a really cool idea and all but sometimes you just don't want to live anymore. I mean, think about it, if people don't die, then what's the point of living forever?. And also, people would get pretty bored just sitting around, and then they probably would just go crazy. 

Yeah, maybe it's ok if you need to see someone for one last time knowing you're not going to die but knowing that you're not going to die and knowing that you'll never die is just too much.

On the bright side, the benefits of not dying would include being able to do things you've never done before such as travel to places you've never been or go swimming on the ocean floor for the first time. You can do A LOT of things if you never die. You could visit every single continent if you wanted, and you'll be able to experience a lot of things for the first time.

So there are some benefits to not dying but let's be real most people would want to die at some point. I mean what else is there to do if you've already traveled the world, swam up the highest mountain, and gone into space. What are you living for if you've already done everything.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

I'm not sure where I stand on the idea of immortality. Immortality seems like a really cool idea and all but sometimes you just don't want to live anymore. I mean, think about it, if people don't die, then what's the point of living forever?. And also, people would get pretty bored just sitting around, and then they probably would just go crazy. 

Yeah, maybe it's ok if you need to see someone for one last time knowing you're not going to die but knowing that you're not going to die and knowing that you'll never die is just too much.

On the bright side, the benefits of not dying would include being able to do things you've never done before such as travel to places you've never been or go swimming on the ocean floor for the first time. You can do A LOT of things if you never die. You could visit every single continent if you wanted, and you'll be able to experience a lot of things for the first time.

So there are some benefits to not dying but let's be real most people would want to die at some point. I mean what else is there to do if you've already traveled the world, swam up the highest mountain, and gone into space. What are you living for if you've already done everything.

I'm not sure where I stand on the idea of immortality. Immortality seems like a really cool idea and all but sometimes you just don't want to live anymore. I mean, think about it, if people don't die, then what's the point of living forever?. And also, people would get pretty bored just sitting around, and then they probably would just go crazy. 

Yeah, maybe it's ok if you need to see someone for one last time knowing you're not going to die but knowing that you're not going to die and knowing that you'll never die is just too much.

You can do A LOT of things if you never die. You could visit every single continent if you wanted, and you'll be able to experience a lot of things for the first time.
