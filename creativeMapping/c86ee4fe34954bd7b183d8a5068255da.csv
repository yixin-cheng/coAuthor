The bee speaks. ""No, Your Majesty, do not strike. I am your loyal servant, and I will not harm you."" You wonder if you've already been stung, and this is some strange, venom-induced, hallucination. You try to recover your composure, and ask the obvious question. ""How can you speak?"" The bee responds. ""I have been given the gift of speech by the Queen of the Bees, and I have been sent to you to help you."" ""Help me do what? Why did you call me 'Your Majesty?' you ask. ""Your mother, the Queen of the Bees is dying, and you are the Princess of Bees, her heir. She has sent me to help you become the new Queen of the Bees.""

""How is any of this possible?"" you ask. ""My mother is human, and I am human."" You pause. ""Also, I'm allergic to bees."" The bee buzzes closer, and you feel a moment of panic, but calm down. ""Every Princess of the Bees is sent to live among humans, to learn about them and their ways, to prepare her for dealing with them in her future role as Queen."" ""And my human mother?""

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You look around in confusion, and then in panic, when you spot the bee. You raise your hand cautiously to try to swat it, or  brush it off.

The bee speaks. ""No, Your Majesty, do not strike. I am your loyal servant, and I will not harm you."" You wonder if you've already been stung, and this is some strange, venom-induced, hallucination. You try to recover your composure, and ask the obvious question. ""How can you speak?"" The bee responds. ""I have been given the gift of speech by the Queen of the Bees, and I have been sent to you to help you."" ""Help me do what? Why did you call me 'Your Majesty?' you ask. ""Your mother, the Queen of the Bees is dying, and you are the Princess of Bees, her heir. She has sent me to help you become the new Queen of the Bees.""

""How is any of this possible?"" you ask. ""My mother is human, and I am human."" You pause. ""Also, I'm allergic to bees."" The bee buzzes closer, and you feel a moment of panic, but calm down. ""Every Princess of the Bees is sent to live among humans, to learn about them and their ways, to prepare her for dealing with them in her future role as Queen."" ""And my human mother?""


""She was chosen to be your guardian, to pkeep you from the bees, until you were ready, and show you the manner of humankind, who we must negotiate with for our hives."" The bee pauses, and there's a knock on the door.

""How is any of this possible?"" you ask. ""My mother is human, and I am human."" You pause. ""Also, I'm allergic to bees."" The bee buzzes closer, and you feel a moment of panic, but calm down. ""Every Princess of the Bees is sent to live among humans, to learn about them and their ways, to prepare her for dealing with them in her future role as Queen."" ""And my human mother?""

She was chosen to be your guardian, to pkeep you from the bees, until you were ready, and show you the manner of humankind, who we must negotiate with for our hives."" The bee pauses, and there's a knock on the door.

Your 'mother' enters, and you look at her in confusion. She rushes to you and hugs you. ""All my life, I have loved you and cared for you as my own child, and now I must lose you."" She wipes a tear from her eye. You begin to get teary-eyed too. ""Don't be sad, this is your destiny, and I am so proud of you my heart is bursting. Go to your subjects.""

You raise your hand cautiously to try to swat it, or  brush it off.

The bee speaks. ""No, Your Majesty, do not strike. I am your loyal servant, and I will not harm you."" You wonder if you've already been stung, and this is some strange, venom-induced, hallucination. You try to recover your composure, and ask the obvious question. ""How can you speak?"" The bee responds. ""I have been given the gift of speech by the Queen of the Bees, and I have been sent to you to help you."" ""Help me do what? Why did you call me 'Your Majesty?' you ask. ""Your mother, the Queen of the Bees is dying, and you are the Princess of Bees, her heir. She has sent me to help you become the new Queen of the Bees.""

""Every Princess of the Bees is sent to live among humans, to learn about them and their ways, to prepare her for dealing with them in her future role as Queen."" ""And my human mother?""

She was chosen to be your guardian, to pkeep you from the bees, until you were ready, and show you the manner of humankind, who we must negotiate with for our hives."" The bee pauses, and there's a knock on the door.

Your 'mother' enters, and you look at her in confusion. She rushes to you and hugs you. ""All my life, I have loved you and cared for you as my own child, and now I must lose you."" She wipes a tear from her eye. You begin to get teary-eyed too. ""Don't be sad, this is your destiny, and I am so proud of you my heart is bursting. Go to your subjects.""

The bee buzzes expectantly. You feel your human form begin to melt away, and you feel the buzzing of wings.  With  a backward look at your former mother, you see her smile through multi-faceted eyes, then fly away to rule your new ",user,39,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
