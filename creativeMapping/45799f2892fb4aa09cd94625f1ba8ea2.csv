The result of this is a world where the young are numerous, and healthy, and will live indefinitely, but lack motivation and volition.

Although you are all very old, it is only natural that the members of the ""Lost Generations"" step in and supply leadership to the young, compliant population. It starts in a benign enough fashion. You and your cohorts are tasked with creating a new government, and you do so. You put the young to work at productive endeavors, and you make sure that society continues to function as it always has. However, a few of your group are not satisfied with this. They see the young as a resource to be exploited, and they want to take advantage of their numbers and their lack of free will. Slowly, they insinuate tasks that are more and more morally questionable into your government's agenda.

They put them to work in factories, they put them to work in mines,  some of the old men even use the complaint young women as workers in brothels for their own amusement. They put them to work developing a new version of the drug, one that will not cause the side effects of the original, and that functions on the old. The young scientists, though lacking in free will, are still capable, and the new drug is developed in a matter of months, and works. Now it is guaranteed that the old will live forever, and the young will be there to serve them according to whatever their sick, sometimes senile, whims may be.

Although you are all very old, it is only natural that the members of the ""Lost Generations"" step in and supply leadership to the young, compliant population. It starts in a benign enough fashion. You and your cohorts are tasked with creating a new government, and you do so. You put the young to work at productive endeavors, and you make sure that society continues to function as it always has. However, a few of your group are not satisfied with this. They see the young as a resource to be exploited, and they want to take advantage of their numbers and their lack of free will. Slowly, they insinuate tasks that are more and more morally questionable into your government's agenda.

They put them to work in factories, they put them to work in mines,  some of the old men even use the complaint young women as workers in brothels for their own amusement. They put them to work developing a new version of the drug, one that will not cause the side effects of the original, and that functions on the old. The young scientists, though lacking in free will, are still capable, and the new drug is developed in a matter of months, and works. Now it is guaranteed that the old will live forever, and the young will be there to serve them according to whatever their sick, sometimes senile, whims may be.

You, and some of the other ""Lost Generation"" members see this for the atrocity it is, and you try to stop it. You put your own complaint scientists to work developing yet another drug, that will negate all the effects of the previously developed serum.

This drug also works; you introduce it to the world's populace as a gas, and before long the young regain their will, but lose their immortality, and the old start aging normally again.

text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. As it turns out, the drug has caused the people who took it to lose their free will. The result of this is a world where the young are numerous, and healthy, and will live indefinitely, but lack motivation and volition.

Although you are all very old, it is only natural that the members of the ""Lost Generations"" step in and supply leadership to the young, compliant population. It starts in a benign enough fashion. You and your cohorts are tasked with creating a new government, and you do so. You put the young to work at productive endeavors, and you make sure that society continues to function as it always has. However, a few of your group are not satisfied with this. They see the young as a resource to be exploited, and they want to take advantage of their numbers and their lack of free will. Slowly, they insinuate tasks that are more and more morally questionable into your government's agenda.

They put them to work in factories, they put them to work in mines,  some of the old men even use the complaint young women as workers in brothels for their own amusement. They put them to work developing a new version of the drug, one that will not cause the side effects of the original, and that functions on the old. The young scientists, though lacking in free will, are still capable, and the new drug is developed in a matter of months, and works. Now it is guaranteed that the old will live forever, and the young will be there to serve them according to whatever their sick, sometimes senile, whims may be.

You, and some of the other ""Lost Generation"" members see this for the atrocity it is, and you try to stop it. You put your own complaint scientists to work developing yet another drug, that will negate all the effects of the previously developed serum.

This drug also works; you introduce it to the world's populace as a gas, and before long the young regain their will, but lose their immortality, and the old start aging normally again.

You put the young to work at productive endeavors, and you make sure that society continues to function as it always has. However, a few of your group are not satisfied with this. They see the young as a resource to be exploited, and they want to take advantage of their numbers and their lack of free will. Slowly, they insinuate tasks that are more and more morally questionable into your government's agenda.

They put them to work in factories, they put them to work in mines,  some of the old men even use the complaint young women as workers in brothels for their own amusement. They put them to work developing a new version of the drug, one that will not cause the side effects of the original, and that functions on the old. The young scientists, though lacking in free will, are still capable, and the new drug is developed in a matter of months, and works. Now it is guaranteed that the old will live forever, and the young will be there to serve them according to whatever their sick, sometimes senile, whims may be.

You, and some of the other ""Lost Generation"" members see this for the atrocity it is, and you try to stop it. You put your own complaint scientists to work developing yet another drug, that will negate all the effects of the previously developed serum.

This drug also works; you introduce it to the world's populace as a gas, and before long the young regain their will, but lose their immortality, and the old start aging normally again.

You put the young to work at productive endeavors, and you make sure that society continues to function as it always has. However, a few of your group are not satisfied with this.

Slowly, they insinuate tasks that are more and more morally questionable into your government's agenda.

They put them to work in factories, they put them to work in mines,  some of the old men even use the complaint young women as workers in brothels for their own amusement. They put them to work developing a new version of the drug, one that will not cause the side effects of the original, and that functions on the old. The young scientists, though lacking in free will, are still capable, and the new drug is developed in a matter of months, and works. Now it is guaranteed that the old will live forever, and the young will be there to serve them according to whatever their sick, sometimes senile, whims may be.

You, and some of the other ""Lost Generation"" members see this for the atrocity it is, and you try to stop it. You put your own complaint scientists to work developing yet another drug, that will negate all the effects of the previously developed serum.

This drug also works; you introduce it to the world's populace as a gas, and before long the young regain their will, but lose their immortality, and the old start aging normally again.
