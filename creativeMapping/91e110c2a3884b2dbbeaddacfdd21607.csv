Ok, so really I KNEW I wasn't really number one. I knew it, my kid didn't though. Now I have to have a hard talk with Junior. He's always looked up to me, thinking I'm best. Really, I'm far from it. I don't know what I'm really doing half the time. Out of the approx. 1 1/2 million cup holders, (this is ONLY the surviving legible relics really, broken ones that are unreadable are excluded from ranking, eliminating a surprising number of crockery.) my rank is lowly, but not in awful company. I'm in the middle, at a ranking of 767,198 I'm above a surprising number. To me, no shock, to Junior, a question that now is raised, makes him curious and a bit hurt.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.  Now the truth was out. I am at once chagrined and relieved. Ok, so really I KNEW I wasn't really number one. I knew it, my kid didn't though. Now I have to have a hard talk with Junior. He's always looked up to me, thinking I'm best. Really, I'm far from it. I don't know what I'm really doing half the time. Out of the approx. 1 1/2 million cup holders, (this is ONLY the surviving legible relics really, broken ones that are unreadable are excluded from ranking, eliminating a surprising number of crockery.) my rank is lowly, but not in awful company. I'm in the middle, at a ranking of 767,198 I'm above a surprising number. To me, no shock, to Junior, a question that now is raised, makes him curious and a bit hurt.

Junior seems more hurt than I would have imagined. Ok, so this is what I'll say. I'm writing this out here, so I can refine it and perhaps change my mind before it's too late.

There are more men (and a few women) that are better fathers, for sure. They give up all their dreams to father and mentor. I DO NOT do this. I follow my own path, allowing you to  sort of fend for yourself more than I should. I disagree with experts, letting you do too many dumb things. I also make way too many mistakes.


But, you know, if I had to do it all over again?
 I'd not change things. I Love you for you. I want you to do your best and It's my opinion that I should just do what I can to help out. I'm too selfish though, really, that's true. I just want you to understand that I love you but I'm not perfect. Please don't imagine I'm better than I am. Just love me for me, and I'll love you for you.
