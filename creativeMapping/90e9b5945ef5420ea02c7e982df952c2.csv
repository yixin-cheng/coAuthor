The wolf said, ""But I'm hungry.""

The Pig said, ""Well, I'm not going to let you in, so you'll just have to go hungry.""

So the wolf was like, ""Oh, I guess I'll have to try something else."" Then he came up with another off the wall idea. He went to the store and bought a bunch of grenades. The Pig said, ""if the dynamite didn't work the grenades definitely won't work!"" ""But what will I eat? I'm so hungry!"", the Wolf exclaimed. The Pig said, ""Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you in. ""Do you have any food?"" asked the Wolf. ""No,"" said the Pig. ""Well, I'm going to go to the store and get some food."" So the Wolf went to the store instead and bought some sandwiches. He brought them back to share with the Pig. The Pig said, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you in. ""Even for some sandwiches?"" asked the Wolf. So the pig went outside and had a sandwich with the Wolf. Then the wolf said, ""I'm still hungry."" And then he ate the Pig as well. The Wolf went on his way fat and happy",user,39,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf came to the 92nd little pig's house and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in.
 The Pig said, ""No way buddy."" 
The wolf said, ""But I'm hungry.""

The Pig said, ""Well, I'm not going to let you in, so you'll just have to go hungry.""
 So the wolf got a crazy idea. He went to the store and bought a bunch of dynamite. He lit the dynamite in an attempt to blow up the house. But the Pig was like, ""Dude, that's not going to work. My house is made out of depleted uranium."" But nevertheless, the wolf set out to blow the house. It didn't work. After the dynamite went off the house still stood. So the wolf was like, ""Oh, I guess I'll have to try something else."" Then he came up with another off the wall idea. He went to the store and bought a bunch of grenades. The Pig said, ""if the dynamite didn't work the grenades definitely won't work!"" ""But what will I eat? I'm so hungry!"", the Wolf exclaimed. The Pig said, ""Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you in. ""Do you have any food?"" asked the Wolf. ""No,"" said the Pig. ""Well, I'm going to go to the store and get some food.""
