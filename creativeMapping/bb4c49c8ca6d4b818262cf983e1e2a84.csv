You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked. 
""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.

You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.

""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.
"" spoke (buzzed?) the tiny bee. ""We've been trying to reach you for so long, I became over-excited. I am a bee of the Royal Guard, and I am here to protect you, your Majesty.""

You look around, making sure no one is watching.
 ""I don't understand. I thought you were the dangerous ones."" 
""We are dangerous, your Majesty, but only to those who would harm you.

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""
""Yes, your Majesty."" said the bee, not laughing.
 ""Please calm down, hysterics will not help anyone, and are not appropriate for royalty. I have finally found you and would be happy to escort you back to the kingdom, to home.""
