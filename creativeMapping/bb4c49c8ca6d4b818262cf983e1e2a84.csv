You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked. 
""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""

You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked. 
""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.

You look around, making sure no one is watching.
 ""I don't understand. I thought you were the dangerous ones."" 
""We are dangerous, your Majesty, but only to those who would harm you.

You shake your head.
 ""I don't even know what that means. I mean, I thought I knew the truth, but no one ever mentioned I could talk to bees before...""

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""

You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked.

You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked. 
""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.

 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human.

You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.

""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.
"" spoke (buzzed?) the tiny bee. ""We've been trying to reach you for so long, I became over-excited. I am a bee of the Royal Guard, and I am here to protect you, your Majesty.""

You look around, making sure no one is watching.

""I see."" said the bee. ""It's a long story your Majesty""

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""

You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked. 
""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.
"" spoke (buzzed?) the tiny bee. ""We've been trying to reach you for so long, I became over-excited. I am a bee of the Royal Guard, and I am here to protect you, your Majesty.""

You look around, making sure no one is watching.

""We are dangerous, your Majesty, but only to those who would harm you.

You shake your head.

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""

""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human.

"" spoke (buzzed?) the tiny bee. ""We've been trying to reach you for so long, I became over-excited. I am a bee of the Royal Guard, and I am here to protect you, your Majesty.""

You look around, making sure no one is watching.
 ""I don't understand. I thought you were the dangerous ones."" 
""We are dangerous, your Majesty, but only to those who would harm you.
 I take it you do not know the truth about yourself?"" 
You shake your head.
 ""I don't even know what that means. I mean, I thought I knew the truth, but no one ever mentioned I could talk to bees before...""

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""
""Yes, your Majesty."" said the bee, not laughing.
 ""Please calm down, hysterics will not help anyone, and are not appropriate for royalty. I have finally found you and would be happy to escort you back to the kingdom, to home.""

"" spoke (buzzed?) the tiny bee. ""We've been trying to reach you for so long, I became over-excited. I am a bee of the Royal Guard, and I am here to protect you, your Majesty.""

You look around, making sure no one is watching.
 ""I don't understand. I thought you were the dangerous ones."" 
""We are dangerous, your Majesty, but only to those who would harm you.
 I take it you do not know the truth about yourself?"" 
You shake your head.
 ""I don't even know what that means. I mean, I thought I knew the truth, but no one ever mentioned I could talk to bees before..."" 

""I see."" said the bee. ""It's a long story your Majesty""

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""
""Yes, your Majesty."" said the bee, not laughing.
 ""Please calm down, hysterics will not help anyone, and are not appropriate for royalty. I have finally found you and would be happy to escort you back to the kingdom, to home.""
""No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going anywhere with you."" you say.

 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""
""Yes, your Majesty."" said the bee, not laughing.
 ""Please calm down, hysterics will not help anyone, and are not appropriate for royalty. I have finally found you and would be happy to escort you back to the kingdom, to home.""
""No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going anywhere with you."" you say.
 ""Are you insane? Why would I want to be a bee, ""prince or no?""

And with that you grabbed a net and scooped up the bee. You had been taught to respect all life after all, so you merely bright the bee to a window, pointed a fan at it, and blew it out. Then you shut the window. From then on, you never complained about your family's over-protectiveness when it came to bees",user,49,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

You spin around, looking for who could possibly be speaking to you. You see a tiny bee, no bigger than a quarter, as it flies up from your shoulder to hover in front of your face. You know you should scream and run, but you are simply too shocked. 
""I'm sorry, your Majesty, I didn't mean to startle you.
"" spoke (buzzed?) the tiny bee. ""We've been trying to reach you for so long, I became over-excited. I am a bee of the Royal Guard, and I am here to protect you, your Majesty.""

You look around, making sure no one is watching.
 ""I don't understand. I thought you were the dangerous ones."" 
""We are dangerous, your Majesty, but only to those who would harm you.
 I take it you do not know the truth about yourself?"" 
You shake your head.
 ""I don't even know what that means. I mean, I thought I knew the truth, but no one ever mentioned I could talk to bees before..."" 

""I see."" said the bee. ""It's a long story your Majesty""

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
