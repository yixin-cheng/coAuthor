""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you."" 

""You do?"" he asked. ""Yes. I forgive you."" she said. ""Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back.""

""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you."" 

""You do?"" he asked. ""Yes. I forgive you."" she said. ""Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back."" 

""But I don't have much time,"" the man said. ""I know, but I'll be right back."" she said. ""Just wait here. And...think."" 

She left the room, and went to the kitchen. She never went back into the room. The man was still sitting there, thinking about his last day on earth. She snuck out to the car and drove away.
