The man decided he had enough, and wanted to die. He declined his dose of the drug and decided to live out his last days at home. His wife, however, was not ready to let him go. She begged him to take the drug. He refused. She was devastated. She had already taken her dose, and was going to live on now without him. She decided to take matters into her own hands. One morning, she was making breakfast. He thought it was going to be his last breakfast. He was sitting at the table, and she was cooking. When he wasn't looking, the woman poured the drug into his tea. She then brought his cup to him where he was seated. He took a sip of his tea, and then another. He was quiet, thinking about his last day on earth. ""Listen honey, there's something I want to confess."" he said. ""I've been cheating on you."" She was shocked. ""With who?"" she asked. ""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

You're given the choice: take the drug or die. 

The man decided he had enough, and wanted to die. He declined his dose of the drug and decided to live out his last days at home. His wife, however, was not ready to let him go. She begged him to take the drug. He refused. She was devastated. She had already taken her dose, and was going to live on now without him. She decided to take matters into her own hands. One morning, she was making breakfast. He thought it was going to be his last breakfast. He was sitting at the table, and she was cooking. When he wasn't looking, the woman poured the drug into his tea. She then brought his cup to him where he was seated. He took a sip of his tea, and then another. He was quiet, thinking about his last day on earth. ""Listen honey, there's something I want to confess."" he said. ""I've been cheating on you."" She was shocked. ""With who?"" she asked. ""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you."" 

""You do?"" he asked. ""Yes. I forgive you."" she said. ""Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back."" 

""But I don't have much time,"" the man said. ""I know, but I'll be right back."" she said. ""Just wait here. And...think."" 

She left the room, and went to the kitchen. She never went back into the room. The man was still sitting there, thinking about his last day on earth. She snuck out to the car and drove away. And he sat there, thinking.  And thinking. He thought of every good thing he'd ever done. He thought of every bad thing he'd ever done. He thought about his wife. He wondered about what she would confess to. He thought about his life. He sat there waiting for death to come, only to be  met with more thoughts and memories.

The man decided he had enough, and wanted to die. He declined his dose of the drug and decided to live out his last days at home. His wife, however, was not ready to let him go. She begged him to take the drug. He refused. She was devastated. She had already taken her dose, and was going to live on now without him. She decided to take matters into her own hands. One morning, she was making breakfast. He thought it was going to be his last breakfast. He was sitting at the table, and she was cooking. When he wasn't looking, the woman poured the drug into his tea. She then brought his cup to him where he was seated. He took a sip of his tea, and then another. He was quiet, thinking about his last day on earth. ""Listen honey, there's something I want to confess."" he said. ""I've been cheating on you."" She was shocked. ""With who?"" she asked. ""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you.""

And he sat there, thinking.  And thinking. He thought of every good thing he'd ever done. He thought of every bad thing he'd ever done. He thought about his wife. He wondered about what she would confess to. He thought about his life. He sat there waiting for death to come, only to be  met with more thoughts and memories.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you.""
