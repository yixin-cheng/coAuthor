""This is the United States Airforce, leave the Matt Damon alone, and come out with your hands up!"" a voice shouted. Svirrak and the female alien looked at each other, then sighed as they raised their hands. ""We surrender"" Svirrak hissed.
As soon as the hammerhead aliens saw that the Airforce sad arrived, they all raised their hands.
 The Airforce officers quickly rounded up the aliens and handcuffed them. ""You okay?"" The officer asked Matt Damon. ""We came as quickly as we could."" 
Matt Damon stepped out of the cage and dusted himself off.
 ""My arm's a little sore, but I think I'm fine,"" he said. ""This is the 3rd time this month this has happened. I need to hire myself a bodyguard."" 
The officer nodded.
 ""We'll take you to the safety of Area 51. From there we'll get a helicopter to take you home. You can get some rest.""

Matt nodded. ""All in a day's work"", he said.",user,45,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
