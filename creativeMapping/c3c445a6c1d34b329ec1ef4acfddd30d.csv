I could help but think of what a crazy name greg was for a bee. ""Well, I dont know what to tell you greg, i dont know what you are talking about."" I said. ""Can you stop being ridiculous and give me your orders man. Jesus christ, im literally here asking to perform your orders. The things i would do to have a servant."" the bee said. Well, now this bee has an attitude with me i thought, let me just see where this goes. ""Well, im not sure what you are talking about, but i guess i could use a servant, so why not. How about some orange juice"" I asked. Just like that, the bee flew over and grabbed a bottle of orange juice from the hand of some little girl. To be honest this was my favorite part of the day. This little bee literally snatched this orange juice like a grown man. Just as i was handed the orange juice by the bee, i woke up from my dream. Only i didnt know it was a dream. Well, look forward to going to sleep tomorrow i guess",user,33,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1615,text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

""Excuse me?"" I asked. Was this little bee that i was deathly afraid of really whispering into my ear right now? Your orders, Your Majesty.""
 Spoke the bee. Well, i guess i can be sure that i wasnt just hearing things. I was being spoken to by a Bee..... i think i have gone crazy. Or maybe I am dead, yea i must have died and this is what the afterlife is like. In this life bees can whisper into my ear, i guess i just have to accept it. Or maybe this is reality? I dont know. ""Hey bee, can you tell me what you are talking about?"". I asked. ""My name is greg first of all your majesty, and I just want to know what your orders are please.""
