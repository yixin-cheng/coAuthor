On a piece of paper, the Main Character sketched out the story. There was childhood, romantic life, career, old age... Romantic life needed more. Much more. And the ending wasn't an ending at all. The Main Character scribbled some notes onto the sketch, and was ready for the next step. The Main Character traveled back to the part of the film with the love story. It wasn't a romance. It was too dull, too predictable. The Main Character would have to spice it up a little bit. She added new music to the scenes with the love interest. The melody was more complex. ""This will be more fun to watch.""

Now it was time to work on the ending. It was a happy ending, but it needed more. She looked back to the film shots of the love story, and the man, and how they danced together. She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film.

During the film, a wave of nostalgia comes over. You look at the people around you who are also experiencing that wave, and then you realize that it has been happening every time someone in your previous life. Things like regrets and missed chances rush through your mind. You then realize that you have never truly lived life to the fullest and you want to change that. 

You stand up in the cinema and shout, ""Stop!"" The screen goes black. Everyone in the audience looks up, confused. 

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I can't let the film go on. I need to make it better."" You turn to the man sitting next to you. ""Give me a little more time, please, and I'll make the film the best it can be. I'll give it the best love story, and finish it off with a bang!""

On a piece of paper, the Main Character sketched out the story. There was childhood, romantic life, career, old age... Romantic life needed more. Much more. And the ending wasn't an ending at all. The Main Character scribbled some notes onto the sketch, and was ready for the next step. The Main Character traveled back to the part of the film with the love story. It wasn't a romance. It was too dull, too predictable. The Main Character would have to spice it up a little bit. She added new music to the scenes with the love interest. The melody was more complex. ""This will be more fun to watch.""

Now it was time to work on the ending. It was a happy ending, but it needed more. She looked back to the film shots of the love story, and the man, and how they danced together. She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film.

She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film.

You watch as you slowly become an adult, get married, have kids and experience all the highs and lows of life. 

During the film, a wave of nostalgia comes over. You look at the people around you who are also experiencing that wave, and then you realize that it has been happening every time someone in your previous life. Things like regrets and missed chances rush through your mind. You then realize that you have never truly lived life to the fullest and you want to change that. 

You stand up in the cinema and shout, ""Stop!"" The screen goes black. Everyone in the audience looks up, confused.

""This will be more fun to watch.""

Now it was time to work on the ending. It was a happy ending, but it needed more. She looked back to the film shots of the love story, and the man, and how they danced together. She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film. 

The audience gathered again in the cinema. The Main Character sat down in her reclining chair and watched the New Film. The film began to play, and the audience members faces lit up with joy.

During the film, a wave of nostalgia comes over. You look at the people around you who are also experiencing that wave, and then you realize that it has been happening every time someone in your previous life. Things like regrets and missed chances rush through your mind. You then realize that you have never truly lived life to the fullest and you want to change that. 

You stand up in the cinema and shout, ""Stop!"" The screen goes black. Everyone in the audience looks up, confused. 

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I can't let the film go on. I need to make it better."" You turn to the man sitting next to you. ""Give me a little more time, please, and I'll make the film the best it can be. I'll give it the best love story, and finish it off with a bang!""

Now it was time to work on the ending. It was a happy ending, but it needed more. She looked back to the film shots of the love story, and the man, and how they danced together. She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film. 

The audience gathered again in the cinema. The Main Character sat down in her reclining chair and watched the New Film. The film began to play, and the audience members faces lit up with joy.

You look at the people around you who are also experiencing that wave, and then you realize that it has been happening every time someone in your previous life. Things like regrets and missed chances rush through your mind. You then realize that you have never truly lived life to the fullest and you want to change that. 

You stand up in the cinema and shout, ""Stop!"" The screen goes black. Everyone in the audience looks up, confused. 

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I can't let the film go on. I need to make it better."" You turn to the man sitting next to you. ""Give me a little more time, please, and I'll make the film the best it can be. I'll give it the best love story, and finish it off with a bang!""

Now it was time to work on the ending. It was a happy ending, but it needed more. She looked back to the film shots of the love story, and the man, and how they danced together. She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film. 

The audience gathered again in the cinema. The Main Character sat down in her reclining chair and watched the New Film. The film began to play, and the audience members faces lit up with joy. The New Film was a masterpiece. The scenes with the love story were so romantic.
