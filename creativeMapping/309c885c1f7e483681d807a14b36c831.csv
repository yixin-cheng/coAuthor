The #1 Dad mug was manufactured in a factory under special conditions and blessed by the Pope.  The mug is being kept safely in a special vault until Father's Day. Every year, people try to steal the mug, but are unsuccessful in their efforts. This year, it is rumored that the mug has a special power to it. The mug is so powerful that it will destroy the whole earth if it's put in the wrong hands. The night before Father's Day, something terrible happens. Someone breaks into the vault and steals the mug! The person that stole the mug is unaware of its special powers. They take the mug with them and use it to drink their morning coffee.

That morning there is a press conference. The police announce that the mug has been stolen and that the thief must be stopped before it's too late. One reporter raises their hand to ask a question. ""I heard that the mug has special powers. Is this true?"" The police officer pauses and responds. ""It's true. The mug has powers. Anyone that drinks from this mug can easily...um...impregnate any woman in a 5-yard radius."" 
All of the reporters start yelling, ""What!
 Why on earth would anyone make a mug like that?"" 

The officer responded. ""Well you see, it was for someone in particular that wasn't able to have kids of their own. This was sort of an experiment."" 
The reporters are still in shock about the mug's special powers.

Anyone that drinks from this mug can easily...um...impregnate any woman in a 5-yard radius."" 
All of the reporters start yelling, ""What!

The #1 Dad mug was manufactured in a factory under special conditions and blessed by the Pope.  The mug is being kept safely in a special vault until Father's Day.

The mug is so powerful that it will destroy the whole earth if it's put in the wrong hands. The night before Father's Day, something terrible happens. Someone breaks into the vault and steals the mug! The person that stole the mug is unaware of its special powers. They take the mug with them and use it to drink their morning coffee.

That morning there is a press conference. The police announce that the mug has been stolen and that the thief must be stopped before it's too late. One reporter raises their hand to ask a question. ""I heard that the mug has special powers. Is this true?"" The police officer pauses and responds. ""It's true. The mug has powers. Anyone that drinks from this mug can easily...um...impregnate any woman in a 5-yard radius."" 
All of the reporters start yelling, ""What!

The officer responded. ""Well you see, it was for someone in particular that wasn't able to have kids of their own. This was sort of an experiment."" 
The reporters are still in shock about the mug's special powers.

Just then, there was a loud sound coming from the sky. The reporters looked up and saw a man flying towards them. In a flash, he crash landed on the stage next to the officer. It was Santa Claus.

The mug is so powerful that it will destroy the whole earth if it's put in the wrong hands. The night before Father's Day, something terrible happens. Someone breaks into the vault and steals the mug! The person that stole the mug is unaware of its special powers. They take the mug with them and use it to drink their morning coffee.

That morning there is a press conference. The police announce that the mug has been stolen and that the thief must be stopped before it's too late. One reporter raises their hand to ask a question. ""I heard that the mug has special powers. Is this true?"" The police officer pauses and responds. ""It's true. The mug has powers.
