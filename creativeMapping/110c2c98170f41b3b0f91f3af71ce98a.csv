The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""Do you have any idea how wealthy you all could be living inside all of that uranium?"" The pigs knew the uranium was no longer radioactive, but it was still really strong and they were formulating an idea in their little piggy minds. You see, the little pigs had lived together for so long, they now thought as one brain. The plot developing, was to get all of the big, bad wolves from the entire world into one place. That place being their uranium fortress. 
The wolves, they didn't know it yet, but the little pigs had been watching them.
 The pigs knew of the wealth the wolves had accumulated from eating weaker animals and then taking their fortunes for their own use. This angered the pigs, and many small animal all over the globe. The idea the pigs were going to set into motion was to make the uranium home appear to be an exclusive, super expensive resort that catered only to wolves. The would advertise all sorts of things to attract the wolves to the home. Since most advertising is based on false promises, the pigs felt no guilt in stretching the truth to lure the savage creatures to the home. Only the little pigs knew of the deadly trap they were setting.

The home was fortified even more, making it impossible to escape once the alarms and traps had been set. The invitations to an exclusive, posh, wolves only resort were sent out to every wolf who had amassed great fortune at the expense of others. Over the next week, the wolves began to arrive. Paying what constituted their entire fortune the wolves were admitted to the exclusive 'spa' for a once in a lifetime experience. Or as the pigs later told in their tales of this exploit, an end of a lifetime experience. 
The wolves were shown to their rooms, and they began to make themselves comfortable.
 They were fed luscious meals, made from fake meat, and given all the treatment royalty would expect. When the last wolf of great wealth and power finally arrived, the terminal stages of the plan were set in motion. The pigs all left the fortress quietly in the dark of night. The uranium tomb was locked and secured. The pigs went back home and gave most of their earning to their mother and friends. As for the wolves, they were left to fend for themselves.

The pigs knew the uranium was no longer radioactive, but it was still really strong and they were formulating an idea in their little piggy minds.

The pigs knew the uranium was no longer radioactive, but it was still really strong and they were formulating an idea in their little piggy minds.

The wolves were shown to their rooms, and they began to make themselves comfortable.
