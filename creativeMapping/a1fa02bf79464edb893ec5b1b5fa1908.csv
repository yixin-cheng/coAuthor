One day, the woman is walking down the streets of London, England, when she notices something out of the corner of her eye.

A guy.

Yes, just a guy. Nothing special about him, really: tall, lanky, brown hair, brown eyes, no glasses, wearing a white shirt, black pants, and black shoes. He kind of looks like a model, but he also looks so average that he could be anyone.
But he’s not just anyone.


One foot after the other, eyes straight ahead, she finds herself gravitating toward him, his presence dire.

Stopping in front of him, he finally looks at her.
“I know you,” she says.
