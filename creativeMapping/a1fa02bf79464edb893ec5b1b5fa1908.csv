One day, the woman is walking down the streets of London, England, when she notices something out of the corner of her eye.

A guy.

Yes, just a guy. Nothing special about him, really: tall, lanky, brown hair, brown eyes, no glasses, wearing a white shirt, black pants, and black shoes. He kind of looks like a model, but he also looks so average that he could be anyone.

Stopping in front of him, he finally looks at her.
