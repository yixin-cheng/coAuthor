For generations, Wolf has been the enemy to the pigs and their mother. But after meeting 60 or 70 pigs, Wolf realized he could learn from their determination. Maybe he could even help them from the past mistakes of their elders. He could use his knowledge to meet their needs, and make a mutually beneficial deal.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

Choosing depleted uranium wasn't 92's first choice of building material, nor his second, or even his third. But, after realizing that this was a material that none of his other sibling would use, he accepted this as a challenge. 

For generations, Wolf has been the enemy to the pigs and their mother. But after meeting 60 or 70 pigs, Wolf realized he could learn from their determination. Maybe he could even help them from the past mistakes of their elders. He could use his knowledge to meet their needs, and make a mutually beneficial deal. 
The wolf started to teach the pigs how to be shrewd business people. and one of those lessons came in the form of a town who had shut down its nuclear power plant decades ago.

To be fair, the house itself isn't built out of the uranium itself, but the steel containers that hold the product. The wolf and 92nd pig found out that steel containers were either thrown away, buried, or sold for scrap. These were stackable barrels that exuded a faint glow. Pigs being pigs, housekeeping wasn't always the best, yet bugs never entered 92's property.  
Choosing this material also helped 92 make a profit.
 He was provided a recycling reimbursement by the town as long as he agreed to take safety precautions when entering town. Wolf was proud of the accomplishments of his friend 92. The house he advised his friend to build will last forever and the glow of the property will always remind the town of a thrifty little pig named 92",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
