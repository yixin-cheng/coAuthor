text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

When I turned 85, society was split in two groups. The immortal ones who got the drug and the rest of us. There was a war between the two groups. But something strange started happening and the immortal group was having a new side effect from the drug. A side effect that makes them all young again. The war eventually ended because of this side effect. The immortal people kept getting younger and younger, until some of them became children that needed someone to care for them. I was one of the people who took care of this group. 

It's been really hard taking care of the children who are actually older just because they took that drug. They had to stop making it. And now we have to take care of the children. Eventually these people will all be babies and we will all grow older and pass. It's really eerie to imagine. I hope that when the Lost Generation is gone someone else will take care of the immortal ones - the babies. For now I will continue on, watching the children. ",user,9,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
