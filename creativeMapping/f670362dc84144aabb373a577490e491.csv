After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really so",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with.

The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with.

Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again.

She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business.

After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with.

Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two.

The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again.

She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body. The woman simply can not get his face out of her head and it is starting to get in the way of her peace of mind. She realizes that she is going to have to contact her ex just to help her own mind out. The shapeshifter wins in this instance, and is going to get a second chance. wi",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body. The woman simply can not get his face out of her head and it is starting to get in the way of her peace of mind.

One day, she wakes up in her hotel room, and doesn’t recognize the man lying next to her. The woman fears that she has slept with someone whom she doesnt even know. She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body. The woman simply can not get his face out of her head and it is starting to get in the way of her peace of mind. She realizes that she is going to have to contact her ex just to help her own mind out. The shapeshifter wins in this instance, and is going to get a second chance with the woman.

She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with. Could her eyes be deceiving her, or is that not the face that she thought she saw upon sprinting to the bathroom. Only the work of a shapeshifter could mess with this woman the way she had just been played. The shapeshifter decided to go back to the previous boyfriend's body in order to calm the woman. The woman proceeds to lie down and fall asleep again as it was very early in the morning. 

This time, she wakes up to the alarm and the man next to her shuts it off. Jesus....... it was the first man she had saw, not her previous boyfriend once again. She holds her hand over her mouth, and takes them off as soon as the man turns. ""That was great last night darling. Your really something aren't you."" The woman at this point wasnt sure if her mind was playing tricks on her or if she was just fantasizing her ex boyfriend. Fast forwarding, the woman ends up heading to work from there and contemplates why she keeps seeing her ex boyfriend. Could it be she still has feelings for him, or was it simply due to the two men looking similar? The woman proceeded through her workday and was close to the closing time for the business. Her boss walks down to her cubicle and congradulates her for her recent great work. But oh no, the boss's face resembles that of her ex boyfriends as well, but this time even the body. The woman simply can not get his face out of her head and it is starting to get in the way of her peace of mind. She realizes that she is going to have to contact her ex just to help her own mind out. The shapeshifter wins in this instance, and is going to get a second chance with the woman.
