All of the news stations played stories about the abduction. There was no real way to trace Matt Damon to outer space. The alien hacked the newscasts and released a message.

The alien gave a ransom to the United States government in order to get Matt Damon back home safe and sound. The alien asked for a couple of different things. He wanted money, he wanted jurisdiction over every planet that isn't Earth and he wanted a top of the line rocket ship from NASA.

The government thought it over and found that this wasn't a big deal. The demands weren't out of control so the government agreed to the deal. They sent the alien money, a rocket ship from NASA and allowed the alien to have jurisdiction over all of the planets not named Earth.

Matt Damon was returned home and reunited with his family. The United States public had confidence in their government as they helped save a beloved figure.

On the aliens side, he became a dictator. Little by little he took over each planet. Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, etc. They all were his. He was building a superpower that could one day challenge the United States. Perhaps the government never thought of this aspect and were just comfortable having access to Earth.

The alien gave a ransom to the United States government in order to get Matt Damon back home safe and sound. The alien asked for a couple of different things. He wanted money, he wanted jurisdiction over every planet that isn't Earth and he wanted a top of the line rocket ship from NASA.

The government thought it over and found that this wasn't a big deal. The demands weren't out of control so the government agreed to the deal. They sent the alien money, a rocket ship from NASA and allowed the alien to have jurisdiction over all of the planets not named Earth.

Luckily for both parties, they were able to sign a treaty where they could trade goods and services which would benefit each country.
