 So Washington comes up with a plan. If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.

 So Washington comes up with a plan. If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.

 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.

Many of them just walk off the job: after all, everyone gets social security and Medicare now.
The government tries to force people to work, but it's not working.
 So Washington comes up with a plan. If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.
So the government decides to do what it should have done in the first place: it gives the danoidote t everyone.

 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.
So the government decides to do what it should have done in the first place: it gives the danoidote t everyone.

The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.

The government tries to force people to work, but it's not working.
 So Washington comes up with a plan. If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.

 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.

 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.

 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

The government tries to force people to work, but it's not working.
 So Washington comes up with a plan. If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.
So the government decides to do what it should have done in the first place: it gives the danoidote t everyone.
 Within a few years, garbage begins to be collected, planes take off in a timely fashion, and there is the satisfying sound of machine guns throughout the third world.

The government tries to force people to work, but it's not working.
 So Washington comes up with a plan. If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.
So the government decides to do what it should have done in the first place: it gives the danoidote t everyone.

The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.

 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.

The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.

Many of them just walk off the job: after all, everyone gets social security and Medicare now.
The government tries to force people to work, but i'he plao is nt wa success
 So Washington comes up with a ""solution."" If you don't work, you don't get any social security or Medicare. You get nothing. And if you don't work, you don't get to vote.
The plan works, but not in the way the government expected.
 Instead of going back to work, most people file for disability. Lawyers spring up that, for a few thou, will argue before a disability tribunal that work makes you anxious and depressed, hence mentally ill, which is a protected disability under the Federal Employment Statues.
The government tries to make it harder to get disability, but the lawyers just get better at their jobs.
 Soon, half the country is on disability. And the other half, well, let's just say the other half are not model employees.
So what's the government to do?
 They're running out of money. Not only that, but garbage is going uncollected and planes and trains no longer run on time.

On the other hand, wars have stopped because no one wants to fight in or lead them. And there's no more crime, because no one can be bothered to commit it.
So the government decides to do what it should have done in the first place: it gives the danoidote t everyone.
 Within a few years, garbage begins to be collected, planes take off in a timely fashion, crime is againrampant and there is the satisfying sound of machine guns throughout the third world.
