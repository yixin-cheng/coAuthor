Once Americans figured it out that they were alone in isolation, they decided to use their knowledge of space travel that no one else had quite mastered yet to just move all of America of the planet and settle on another planet. 
The first and primary planet they decided to move to was Mars.
 They knew how to make it a livable planet now. They started launching science and engineering ships up first to create an ionosphere to protect from the sun and space radiation. Soon after they started launching citizens there by the thousands. America was becoming an interstellar nation, no it had a planet all to itself now.

After around 50 more years, by some miracle of technology, Mars was green with foliage, and blue with oceans, rivers, and plenty of water. Americans lived out their time very comfortably on Mars without worrying about what was going on back on Earth anymore. Now they really were isolated, like everyone else wanted.
