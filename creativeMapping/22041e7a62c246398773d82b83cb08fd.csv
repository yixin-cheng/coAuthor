text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. As it turns out, those lengths are pretty short. In fact, humanity doesn't really care about Matt Damon. They think he's terrible at acting and there are plenty of other people in Hollywood who can do that job better. In fact, life on Earth goes on pretty well without Matt Damon. It seems that his conspicuous lifestyle was not beneficial to the environment. After his kidnapping, scientists find out that carbon emissions have gone down significantly, and they've got the absence of Matt Damon to thank for that.

Minus Matt Damon, the Earth is a much better place to live in. Global warming has been reversed, and humanity can worry about other pressing matters, like whether or not Bill Cosby will be running for president. That's one of the less pressing ones though, humanity turns its mind to ending war, hunger, and poverty. The nations of the world put aside their differences, and the U.S., China, Russia, the EU, and the UN, as well as the World Health Organization work together to find a cure for all diseases.

Soon, the Earth is a utopian society. And humanity has Matt Damon to thank for it. Or more properly, his absence. They consider locating his abductors to thank them, but decide that curing cancer and ascending to the next phase of human evolution is more important.

Meanwhile, on the alien vessel, the aliens run into some problems. Matt Damon has been sitting around, eating like a pig, living the conspicuous lifestyle he's grown used to, and the carbon dioxide levels on the ship have been rising rapidly. Realizing ransom isn't a possibility, the aliens frantically search for a way to get rid of him. They end up flying across the universe, and dumping him into a black hole. This later leads to the collapse of an entire galaxy, but that's much later, so for the time being they're okay.

In fact, humanity doesn't really care about Matt Damon. They think he's terrible at acting and there are plenty of other people in Hollywood who can do that job better. In fact, life on Earth goes on pretty well without Matt Damon. It seems that his conspicuous lifestyle was not beneficial to the environment. After his kidnapping, scientists find out that carbon emissions have gone down significantly, and they've got the absence of Matt Damon to thank for that.

Minus Matt Damon, the Earth is a much better place to live in. Global warming has been reversed, and humanity can worry about other pressing matters, like whether or not Bill Cosby will be running for president. That's one of the less pressing ones though, humanity turns its mind to ending war, hunger, and poverty. The nations of the world put aside their differences, and the U.S., China, Russia, the EU, and the UN, as well as the World Health Organization work together to find a cure for all diseases.

Soon, the Earth is a utopian society. And humanity has Matt Damon to thank for it. Or more properly, his absence. They consider locating his abductors to thank them, but decide that curing cancer and ascending to the next phase of human evolution is more important.

Meanwhile, on the alien vessel, the aliens run into some problems. Matt Damon has been sitting around, eating like a pig, living the conspicuous lifestyle he's grown used to, and the carbon dioxide levels on the ship have been rising rapidly. Realizing ransom isn't a possibility, the aliens frantically search for a way to get rid of him. They end up flying across the universe, and dumping him into a black hole. This later leads to the collapse of an entire galaxy, but that's much later, so for the time being they're okay.

After his kidnapping, scientists find out that carbon emissions have gone down significantly, and they've got the absence of Matt Damon to thank for that.

Minus Matt Damon, the Earth is a much better place to live in.

That's one of the less pressing ones though, humanity turns its mind to ending war, hunger, and poverty. The nations of the world put aside their differences, and the U.S., China, Russia, the EU, and the UN, as well as the World Health Organization work together to find a cure for all diseases.

Soon, the Earth is a utopian society. And humanity has Matt Damon to thank for it. Or more properly, his absence. They consider locating his abductors to thank them, but decide that curing cancer and ascending to the next phase of human evolution is more important.

Meanwhile, on the alien vessel, the aliens run into some problems. Matt Damon has been sitting around, eating like a pig, living the conspicuous lifestyle he's grown used to, and the carbon dioxide levels on the ship have been rising rapidly. Realizing ransom isn't a possibility, the aliens frantically search for a way to get rid of him. They end up flying across the universe, and dumping him into a black hole. This later leads to the collapse of an entire galaxy, but that's much later, so for the time being they're okay.
