1425,text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. It causes those who took the drug to become mindless zombies. You and your friends now have to survive as the earth is being overrun by these zombies.

It's not a smooth journey. Your group is people who are close to 90 years old trying to evade zombies. Each attack kills a big chunk of the group as they are too weak to fight and too slow to run. So, how do you survive? How do you get your group to safety? I decide to lead the survivors to an island. On the way to the island, we come across a couple of villages that have survived and are willing to help us. They share supplies and give us a place to rest. 

After a while we end up in front of a row of islands. There's one that stands out as it looks large enough for us to live on. This is where we will settle. We begin setting up little huts and finding food and a water source. It's going pretty well at first. But then, a group of people arrives on their yacht. It's another group of seniors. They however are rich and demand the island for themselves. They claim my group are just squatters and that we've taken more than our share.

A fight ends up developing. It's quite a sight to see. People are falling and breaking their hips. Others are just sitting down to catch their breath. This ends up catching the attention of the zombies who are on the mainland. Many gather, watching in amusement. 
My group and the other seniors make an uneasy truce.
 We'll live together on the island and just avoid each other. We realize we don't have much time left to live anyway so we may as well not spend our last days fighting. The zombies would enjoy watching it too much. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
