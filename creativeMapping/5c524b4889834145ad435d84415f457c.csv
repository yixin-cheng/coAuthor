If i was to take the drug and survive, i would still live how i am now but with no need for food or water. Things would be much easier for me as the rest of the world has changed for the worse and i would have changed with it. But this is the situation i am in right now and just have to deal with it and knowing there is no going back this is how i will die and i have accepted the fact. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
