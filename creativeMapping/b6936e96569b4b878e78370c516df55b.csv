You head back home to see if you should go to the hospital. 
You get home, and your mother is there.

You wake up in a hospital bed, your mother is there.
 She smiles and asks how you feel. You feel tired, but can't remember getting out of the car! You feel relief as the doctor tells you you're fine. The swelling is gone, and you're breathing normally. You take a lesson from this, albeit not the obvious one: you and your mom share a calm approach to life, and you are very grateful to share this trait with her.",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
