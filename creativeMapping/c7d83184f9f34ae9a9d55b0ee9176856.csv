There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again.

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States.

 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with.

The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile.

The United States is now a third world country.
 Soeurette Morley has been elected president for life and has been ruling the country with an iron fist for the past 50 years. Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power.

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power.

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power.

By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States.

The United States is now a third world country.
 Soeurette Morley has been elected president for life and has been ruling the country with an iron fist for the past 50 years. Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States.

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.
 It is a place where people are confident that they have beliefs that will be heard and a place where people know that they can be in a country that will not put the heavy restrictions on them that other countries will. In co",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.
 It is a place where people are confident that they have beliefs that will be heard and a place where people know that they can be in a country that will not put the heavy restrictions on them that other countries will. In conclusion, So",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.
 It is a place where people are confident that they have beliefs that will be heard and a place where people know that they can be in a country that will not put the heavy restrictions on them that other countries will. In conclusion, Soeurette Mo",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 Soeurette Morley has been elected president for life and has been ruling the country with an iron fist for the past 50 years. Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.
 It is a place where people are confident that they have beliefs that will be heard and a place where people know that they can be in a country that will not put the heavy restrictions on them that other countries will.

Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.
 It is a place where people are confident that they have beliefs that will be heard and a place where people know that they can be in a country that will not put the heavy restrictions on them that other countries will.
