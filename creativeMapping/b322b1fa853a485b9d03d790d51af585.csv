When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world. The drug was not as effective as the scientists thought, and it only slowed down the aging process, and could not stop it from happening as they had hoped. The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed.

Disappointing and angry like all the others in the world who were denied immortality, you in the end decided to move on with your life, still at the mercy of the aging process. Many years go by, and those that take the drug still keep their youth while you slowly age as you grow older, like a good chunk of the world.

When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world. The drug was not as effective as the scientists thought, and it only slowed down the aging process, and could not stop it from happening as they had hoped. The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed. Despite efforts to research more into the drug, no cure or treatment was found for its users. It was morbidly proclaimed that all that have taken the drug would suffer the same fate as the first to rapidly age and die, it was however unknown when that may be. 
You are now 91 years old.
 Most if not all of the drug users in the world had passed away from the grim fate that you witnessed many years ago. You have lived a long life, even started a family that produced grandchildren for you. The drug ceased to be administered many years ago once the side effects were discovered, and many on the planet lived their life, as normal as possible and still subject to the aging process.

Disappointing and angry like all the others in the world who were denied immortality, you in the end decided to move on with your life, still at the mercy of the aging process.

When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world. The drug was not as effective as the scientists thought, and it only slowed down the aging process, and could not stop it from happening as they had hoped. The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed. Despite efforts to research more into the drug, no cure or treatment was found for its users. It was morbidly proclaimed that all that have taken the drug would suffer the same fate as the first to rapidly age and die, it was however unknown when that may be.

The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed. Despite efforts to research more into the drug, no cure or treatment was found for its users. It was morbidly proclaimed that all that have taken the drug would suffer the same fate as the first to rapidly age and die, it was however unknown when that may be. 
You are now 91 years old.
 Most if not all of the drug users in the world had passed away from the grim fate that you witnessed many years ago. You have lived a long life, even started a family that produced grandchildren for you. The drug ceased to be administered many years ago once the side effects were discovered, and many on the planet lived their life, as normal as possible and still subject to the aging process. Nevertheless, you along many others have gained a new respect for your lives. Aging was no longer stigmatized all around the world, as many found it as a more pleasant and respectful way to live than the agony that seemed to befall those who died from taking the drug. 
You are now 101 years old.

When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world.

The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed.

Disappointing and angry like all the others in the world who were denied immortality, you in the end decided to move on with your life, still at the mercy of the aging process. Many years go by, and those that take the drug still keep their youth while you slowly age as you grow older, like a good chunk of the world.

When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world. The drug was not as effective as the scientists thought, and it only slowed down the aging process, and could not stop it from happening as they had hoped. The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed. Despite efforts to research more into the drug, no cure or treatment was found for its users. It was morbidly proclaimed that all that have taken the drug would suffer the same fate as the first to rapidly age and die, it was however unknown when that may be.

The drug ceased to be administered many years ago once the side effects were discovered, and many on the planet lived their life, as normal as possible and still subject to the aging process. Nevertheless, you along many others have gained a new respect for your lives. Aging was no longer stigmatized all around the world, as many found it as a more pleasant and respectful way to live than the agony that seemed to befall those who died from taking the drug.

The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed.

To your suprise, when you are 28, a group of scientists discover a drug that stops all effects of aging, creative an effect immortality for its users. The governments all around the world make the decision to distribute and give the give the drug to all citizens under 26, but they also refrain from administering the drug to anyone older than 26 years due to potential risks associated with that age group.

When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world. The drug was not as effective as the scientists thought, and it only slowed down the aging process, and could not stop it from happening as they had hoped. The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed. Despite efforts to research more into the drug, no cure or treatment was found for its users. It was morbidly proclaimed that all that have taken the drug would suffer the same fate as the first to rapidly age and die, it was however unknown when that may be.

To your suprise, when you are 28, a group of scientists discover a drug that stops all effects of aging, creative an effect immortality for its users. The governments all around the world make the decision to distribute and give the give the drug to all citizens under 26, but they also refrain from administering the drug to anyone older than 26 years due to potential risks associated with that age group. Disappointing and angry like all the others in the world who were denied immortality, you in the end decided to move on with your life, still at the mercy of the aging process. Many years go by, and those that take the drug still keep their youth while you slowly age as you grow older, like a good chunk of the world.

When you're 85, side effects of the drug are soon discovered around the world. The drug was not as effective as the scientists thought, and it only slowed down the aging process, and could not stop it from happening as they had hoped. The first case was televised and reported warning people of the side effects, in which a drug user who had taken the drug many years ago suddenly and rapidly aged, dying in the process. The drug was recalled and the governments around the world started to monitor the drug users, and the drug was no longer distributed. Despite efforts to research more into the drug, no cure or treatment was found for its users. It was morbidly proclaimed that all that have taken the drug would suffer the same fate as the first to rapidly age and die, it was however unknown when that may be. 
You are now 91 years old.
 Most if not all of the drug users in the world had passed away from the grim fate that you witnessed many years ago. You have lived a long life, even started a family that produced grandchildren for you. The drug ceased to be administered many years ago once the side effects were discovered, and many on the planet lived their life, as normal as possible and still subject to the aging process.
