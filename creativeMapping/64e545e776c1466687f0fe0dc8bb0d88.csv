The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Anothe",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans.

The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant.

The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell.

text-delete,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, for apparently no other particular reason. He may be quite a high-profile actor, but this is nothing in the overall scheme of things. Why him? Well, he was abducted randomly. Along with countless others. 
The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive. Robotics are automated to monitor him and take samples remotely, in an otherwise non-invasive fashion. att Damon is not alone in his captivity., he is able to see countless others in cells that line a massive corridor through the transparent walls that separate them. 
Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell.

Robotics are automated to monitor him and take samples remotely, in an otherwise non-invasive fashion. att Damon is not alone in his captivity., he is able to see countless others in cells that line a massive corridor through the transparent walls that separate them. 
Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive.

He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive. Robotics are automated to monitor him and take samples remotely, in an otherwise non-invasive fashion. att Damon is not alone in his captivity., he is able to see countless others in cells that line a massive corridor through the transparent walls that separate them. 
Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive. Robotics are automated to monitor him and take samples remotely, in an otherwise non-invasive fashion. att Damon is not alone in his captivity., he is able to see countless others in cells that line a massive corridor through the transparent walls that separate them. 
Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive. Robotics are automated to monitor him and take samples remotely, in an otherwise non-invasive fashion. att Damon is not alone in his captivity., he is able to see countless others in cells that line a massive corridor through the transparent walls that separate them. 
Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight.

The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight. 

He runs down the hall aimlessly before an orb-shaped drone appears in front of him. The drone emits an electrical shock that renders him unconscious once again. When Matt Damon awakes, he is back in his own bed with a headache. Real",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive. Robotics are automated to monitor him and take samples remotely, in an otherwise non-invasive fashion. att Damon is not alone in his captivity., he is able to see countless others in cells that line a massive corridor through the transparent walls that separate them. 
Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors.

The alien, named Zimrr has been sent to Earth to fcollect DNA samples. His mission is to collect and analyze the DNA of the most intelligent species on the planet. The samples are taken randomly from all humans. Part of this process is the abduction and captivity of the donors. 
Zirr is a member of the Ziarithian race, a highly advanced alien civilization. lightyears ahead of humans. They see humans as a lower lifeform. They are not evil, just uncaring and humans are regarded little more than insects are regarded by humans. 

Matt Damon is kept in a very advanced containment unit. It's a glorified cage. He is given the bare necessities to survive.

Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight.

Matt Damon is a man of action.
 He decides to try to escape, but how? He is in a cage in an unknown facility in an unknown location, with no tools, no weapons, and no way to get out. The only thing the automated system in place seems to respond to is his vital readings. He is given food and drink in a square container at specific intervals. He thinks to refuse the nourishing compounds. 

Upon doing so, the system seems to give an alert. An uncomfortable buzzing sound. The robotics are no longer non-invasive, a compartment opens up and forcefully injects something into him. This is the nourishment he attempted to refuse, along with a type of sedative. 
Matt Damon is able to use this to his advantage. upon awakening from a long slumber. He is able to trick the system into giving him a sedative and then a stimulant. He then repeats this process and is able to use the strength from the stimulant to break some of the robotics which he then uses to escape the cell. Another automatic robotic system goes off with a louder buzzing alarm and the cell block glows with a red backlight.
