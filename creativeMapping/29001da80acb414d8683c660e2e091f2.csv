However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children. They would keep his legacy alive, and continue to live in the house, and the bunker, that he had built. avoid predator

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned.

They would try to survive in a harsh world with the homes they would build, out of any materials that they could find. Many found that there homes could not withstand the forces of nature or the attacks of predators, and died soon after. Only one would survive to live to adulthood, the last and youngest of the 20 little pigs.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. 

The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children. They would keep his legacy alive, and continue to live in the house, and the bunker, that he had built. For unlike his siblings, he would still be alive like his descendants, who expanded his underground bunker.
