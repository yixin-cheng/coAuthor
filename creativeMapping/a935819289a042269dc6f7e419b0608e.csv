The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth.

The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings.

The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth.

As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given hum",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

2420,text-insert,"One day Barack Obama awoke to find himself in a mysterious room, empty save for the chair he was in and an enormous light source, brightly illuminating his surroundings. He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind.

The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further.

2474,text-insert,"One day Barack Obama awoke to find himself in a mysterious room, empty save for the chair he was in and an enormous light source, brightly illuminating his surroundings. He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House.

 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further.

As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House.

2514,text-insert,"One day Barack Obama awoke to find himself in a mysterious room, empty save for the chair he was in and an enormous light source, brightly illuminating his surroundings. He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further. Perhaps, Obama thought, it was from the trust they had in humans, ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further. Perhaps, Obama thought, it was from the trust they had in humans, to use the alien statue for the greater good. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further. Perhaps, Obama thought, it was from the trust they had in humans, to use the alien statue for the greater good and to evn",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

2566,text-insert,"One day Barack Obama awoke to find himself in a mysterious room, empty save for the chair he was in and an enormous light source, brightly illuminating his surroundings. He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process.

He thought to himself he was kidnapped, and that he would be held for ransom. As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study.

As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House.

The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream.

Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House.

As a former president, he could still be useful to certain groups due to the classified information he was briefed on during his presidency. Suddenly, the doors opened and he saw who his captors were.

His captors turned out to not be any group found on Earth, for they were extraterrestrial beings. He had been briefed that aliens existed in the universe, but he was surprised to see that they had decided to kidnap him out of all the people in the world. They likely had a reason for doing so, Obama thought, and began considering all the possible outcomes of his encounter.
What Obama did nforesee howeverwas that the aliens were peaceful, and they wished to give him a gift.
 The aliens handed Obama an intricate statue, made from a material Obama had never seen before. In fact, it was a metal not found on Earth, but rather in outer space. The metal was very special and unique, having properties not unlike any of the metals found on Earth. The aliens knew that Obama would put it to good use, and likely hand it over to qualified scientists to analyze it for research. The aliens hoped that the statue would be an inspiration for humanity to make greater strides into their technology, and they urged them to use it wisely. With that, the aliens put Obama back to sleep, and he awoke back at his house.

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further. Perhaps, Obama thought, it was from the trust they had in humans, to use the alien statue for the greater good and to even one day travel the stars to find other alien civiliz",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
