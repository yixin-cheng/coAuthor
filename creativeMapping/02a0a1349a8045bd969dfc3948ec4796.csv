He was kidnapping as he was still driving his car, which was also take in by the alien spacecraft. Nobody could confirm that this was an alien abduction, because there were no witnesses, and Matt Damon had not been able to call for help from his cell phone.

Once on the spaceship, Matt Damon came face to face with its alien driver. The alien began to speak, in an unknown language that he could not perceive. Even its appearance was indescribable, not resembling anything that lived on the planet. Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""You are the actor called Matt Damon, correct?"", spoke the alien in an accent that sounded unlike any he had ever heard on Earth.  
""Y...yes..."", stuttered Matt Damon.
 The aliens upon hearing his response, began talking to one another again, seemingly excited by his response.

""You were Jason Bourne in the Bourne series, and also the lead actor of The Martian, correct?"", the English speaking alien asked inquisitively.
""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from. Albeit confused by the ordeal, he drove back home and went to see his family

Once on the spaceship, Matt Damon came face to face with its alien driver. The alien began to speak, in an unknown language that he could not perceive. Even its appearance was indescribable, not resembling anything that lived on the planet. Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""You are the actor called Matt Damon, correct?"", spoke the alien in an accent that sounded unlike any he had ever heard on Earth.  
""Y...yes..."", stuttered Matt Damon.
 The aliens upon hearing his response, began talking to one another again, seemingly excited by his response.

""You were Jason Bourne in the Bourne series, and also the lead actor of The Martian, correct?"", the English speaking alien asked inquisitively.
""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from.

Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

Once on the spaceship, Matt Damon came face to face with its alien driver. The alien began to speak, in an unknown language that he could not perceive. Even its appearance was indescribable, not resembling anything that lived on the planet. Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving.

Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""You are the actor called Matt Damon, correct?"", spoke the alien in an accent that sounded unlike any he had ever heard on Earth.  
""Y...yes..."", stuttered Matt Damon.
 The aliens upon hearing his response, began talking to one another again, seemingly excited by his response.

""You were Jason Bourne in the Bourne series, and also the lead actor of The Martian, correct?"", the English speaking alien asked inquisitively.
""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from. Albeit confused by the ordeal, he drove back home and went to see his family. Choosing not to worry them about the truth, he made up a lie stating he was stuck in traffic, and resumed the remainder of his day. For he was a bit content of the odd ordeal he was

""Y...yes..."", stuttered Matt Damon.
 The aliens upon hearing his response, began talking to one another again, seemingly excited by his response.

""You were Jason Bourne in the Bourne series, and also the lead actor of The Martian, correct?"", the English speaking alien asked inquisitively.
""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens.

Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""Y...yes..."", stuttered Matt Damon.
 The aliens upon hearing his response, began talking to one another again, seemingly excited by his response.

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from. Albeit confused by the ordeal, he drove back home and went to see his family.

Nobody could confirm that this was an alien abduction, because there were no witnesses, and Matt Damon had not been able to call for help from his cell phone.

Once on the spaceship, Matt Damon came face to face with its alien driver. The alien began to speak, in an unknown language that he could not perceive. Even its appearance was indescribable, not resembling anything that lived on the planet. Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from. Albeit confused by the ordeal, he drove back home and went to see his family. Choosing not to worry them about the truth, he made up a lie stating he was stuck in traffic, and resumed the remainder of his day.

Once on the spaceship, Matt Damon came face to face with its alien driver. The alien began to speak, in an unknown language that he could not perceive. Even its appearance was indescribable, not resembling anything that lived on the planet. Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from. Albeit confused by the ordeal, he drove back home and went to see his family. Choosing not to worry them about the truth, he made up a lie stating he was stuck in traffic, and resumed the remainder of his day.
