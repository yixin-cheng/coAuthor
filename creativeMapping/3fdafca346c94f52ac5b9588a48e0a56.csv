I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.

And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""

So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it.

Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.

And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I would do whatever it took to",user,21,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad.

I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I wondered if I would ever get back to #1. I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place. In the",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I wondered if I would ever get back to #1. I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place. In the end though, mystery unsolved, I decided that I enjoyed being a better dad. Rankin",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I wondered if I would ever get back to #1. I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place. In the end though, mystery unsolved, I decided that I enjoyed being a better dad.

So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I wondered if I would ever get back to #1. I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place. In the end though, mystery unsolved, I decided that I enjoyed being a better dad.
