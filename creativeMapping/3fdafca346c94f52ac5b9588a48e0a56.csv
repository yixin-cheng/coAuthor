I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad.""

Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I wondered if I would ever get back to #1. I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place. In the end though, m",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
 I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I wondered if I would ever get back to #1. I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place. In the end though, mystery unsolved, ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him.

 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again.""

I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. 
The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#5 Dad.""
 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again."" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. 
The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to ""#63Dad.""
