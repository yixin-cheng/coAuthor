Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall.

 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps.

The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport. Matt is sad about the news but realizes there is no other way until all the aliens are killed. The team goes to see him off and wishes him luck, Matt thanks them for the help and says he will never forget them.

Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own.

 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport. Matt is sad about the news but realizes there is no other way until all the aliens are killed.

Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own.

 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport. Matt is sad about the news but realizes there is no other way until all the aliens are killed.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own.

 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport. Matt is sad about the news but realizes there is no other way until all the aliens are killed. The team goes to see him off and wishes him luck, Matt thanks them for the help and says he will never forget them. The president orders a nuclear strike on the alien ship so Matt can finally be safe. They evade the strike and disappear into the darkness of space.
