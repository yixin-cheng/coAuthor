You look down and see a bee the size of a small cat. You've never seen a bee of this size and start to run away. The bee starts to chase you and continues to call you ""Your Majesty.""

You ask the bee why he is following you. The bee tells you that you're the King of the bees now. You tell the bee that's impossible as you're actually allergic to bees. The bee tells you that doesn't matter.

You are the King of the bees now and have to help them escape. They're all stuck in a barn with no windows and no way to escape. Plants and crops are dying and the air quality is worse than usual.

The bee points you towards the barn and you ask him what you have to do. The bee tells you all you have to do is open the door. 

You start to get a bit scared because what if the bees sting you? There are so many bees in there that a bunch of stings could probably kill you. You ask the bee that is the size of a cat how they will know you're not their to harm you. He assures you that you're the King of the bees and they will know that.

You look down and see a bee the size of a small cat. You've never seen a bee of this size and start to run away. The bee starts to chase you and continues to call you ""Your Majesty.""

You ask the bee why he is following you. The bee tells you that you're the King of the bees now. You tell the bee that's impossible as you're actually allergic to bees. The bee tells you that doesn't matter.

You are the King of the bees now and have to help them escape. They're all stuck in a barn with no windows and no way to escape. Plants and crops are dying and the air quality is worse than usual.

The bee points you towards the barn and you ask him what you have to do. The bee tells you all you have to do is open the door. 

You start to get a bit scared because what if the bees sting you? There are so many bees in there that a bunch of stings could probably kill you. You ask the bee that is the size of a cat how they will know you're not their to harm you. He assures you that you're the King of the bees and they will know that.

You go up to the barn door and open the door. The bees weren't strong enough to push it open and they don't have hands. The door swings open and thousands of bees come flying out. You start to panic and fear that you're going to be stung but to your joy, the bees fly right past you.

You are the King of the bees now and have to help them escape. They're all stuck in a barn with no windows and no way to escape. Plants and crops are dying and the air quality is worse than usual.

The bee points you towards the barn and you ask him what you have to do. The bee tells you all you have to do is open the door.
