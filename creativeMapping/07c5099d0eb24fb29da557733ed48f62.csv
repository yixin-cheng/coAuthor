After the film, you enter a door and find yourself in another cinema with about five hundred people.
 You wonder what they are gathered around for. A man in a tuxedo walks up to you and introduces himself as God. He tells you that your time has come, and he is ready to take you to heaven.  

""I am a little shocked. I'm not ready. It's too soon.""  

""No problem,"" says God. ""We have a special program for those with sudden death syndrome.""

""I didn't know I had sudden death syndrome. I didn't know I died!"" 
""Yes you did.
 You wouldn't remember because it happened in your sleep."" said God.

""But I'm young and I'm healthy, or I was."" 
""Well, there was really no point you living anymore."" We decided to take you in your sleep. You see, we have an important job for you that must be done from the higher-ups, if you know what I mean.""

""Me?"" said God. ""You see, I have a lot to do and I need some help in that realm. Here take this."" He held out a hand and offered a wooden gavel. ""You'll need this. You'll figure it out."" 
""Where do I start?""


God pointed to a pearly gate. ""Right through here. If you approve of someone, let 'em in.""

""Gotcha. And what if I don't approve?""

""I am a little shocked. I'm not ready. It's too soon.""  

""No problem,"" says God. ""We have a special program for those with sudden death syndrome.""

""I didn't know I had sudden death syndrome. I didn't know I died!"" 
""Yes you did.
 You wouldn't remember because it happened in your sleep."" said God.

""But I'm young and I'm healthy, or I was.""

""Where do I start?""


God pointed to a pearly gate. ""Right through here. If you approve of someone, let 'em in.""

""Gotcha. And what if I don't approve?""
