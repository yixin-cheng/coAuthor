Women feel resentful for the years they have worked without the involvement of dads. They realize dads could have been doing better all along if they had cared. It turned out it is not a love of a woman that makes a dad care or even the love of a child. What makes a man care is his competitive nature. He wants to win...he wants the top spot. Women are they glad they at least now truly understand men's movtivations.
