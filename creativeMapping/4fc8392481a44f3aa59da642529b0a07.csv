suggestion-get,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

She's a senior at a high school in a small town. The shapeshifter goes to the same high school, and has been watching her for years. He has known her so much for the past year, being with dates with her through the different bodies he used but he couldn't go past the first date and she would always reject him.

Brie, who is ready to graduate this year seem to not be bothered to date seriously any time soon. The shapeshifter, who goes by different names depending on what body he tries on the next morning, seem to think that his time with Brie is running out.

His body today is of a guy named James, who is a senior and a football player. James is a popular person in school, and his personality is confident enough to ask Brie out on a date. 

""Are you free this weekend?"" Asked James to Brie.

""I am free this weekend."" Said Brie. ""Are you asking me out, James, also known as Mr. Popular?""

""Yes, I am."" Says James. ""I'm asking you out on a date.""

The weekend came and Brie and James went to the movies. They seem to have hit it off and they both enjoyed the movie. Right before they were about to go their separate ways, James said, ""My time with you is running out, Brie.""

""Running out how?"" asked Brie,  who got confused. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm not going to be the same guy you know after this."" said James. ""Can I kiss you?""

Brie nodded and James leaned in for a kiss. The next morning, James had no recollection of what happened and Brie was still confused. She got heartbroken, but so was the shapeshifter.
