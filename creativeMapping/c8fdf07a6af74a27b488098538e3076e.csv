I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
