You follow them, and get a moment to savor her dying screams before the bees finish her off. After that is the handyman, since he's handy. Then, a trip to the medical center, to visit the doctor who told you were allergic to bees.

After a long day of bee murder, you decide to go to your room and relax. Tomorrow will be an interesting day at school, you're sure. That pretty girl in 4th period will pay for the names she called you. And the bully who stole your lunch money every day for a year? He'll be eating a diet of bee venom, and you hope he enjoys it.
