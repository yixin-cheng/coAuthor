After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.

The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom.

He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married. 

So, he walks right out of the hospital and starts applying for jobs. You feel sympathetic to the man on the scree",user,44,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him.

He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married. 

So, he walks right out of the hospital and starts applying for jobs. You feel sympathetic to the man on the screen since you understand where he's coming from. At that moment, th",user,45,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child.

 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.

The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go.

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. 
The man's wife is really upset.
 She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's an interesting phenomenon for sure, because you can see your past lives, and you can see the mistakes you made in your previous lives. But the focus of the current film you are watching is your next life, which is about to begin. 
The film you are watching is about a man who is a successful businessman.
 He's in the banking business and he trades stocks for a living. He is married to a woman who is a successful lawyer. His wife is pregnant, and he is trying to decide what to do about his business. After all, trading stocks is a long and hard job, and once the baby arrives, he will have to take time off to be with his wife and child. Of course, he also wants to provide for his wife and child. He is torn. He asks his wife for advice and she tells him that he should quit his job and take care of his family. Unfortunately, his wife also wants to be a stay-at-home mom. The man thinks about the family's finances and realizes that he can't afford to quit his job if his wife is going to stay at home. 

It's really a tough call for him. Because while he loves his wife, he's not really sure how much of a long-term relationship this is really going to be. He has been married before, and he knows that he has a wandering eye. Plus, his wife is really bossy, and even though her body was smoking hot before the pregnancy, she's really starting to put on weight. He's not sure if he can handle her bossiness and her weight gain for the rest of his life. So he's hesitant to just quit his job and let it all go.

His wife is really upset by this. She doesn't understand why he can't just quit his job and take care of her and the baby. ""Honey,"" he says. ""You're a lawyer so you know that I can't just quit my job. You're smart enough to know that our family's finances will be in shambles if I do that.""

His wife has baby brain, and she can't really think straight. A couple of months later, she starts feeling contractions and she goes into labor. The man rushes her to the hospital, and while he's driving, he gets a call from his boss. His boss says, ""I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've got to let you go. I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore."" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. 
The man is devastated.
 He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice.
