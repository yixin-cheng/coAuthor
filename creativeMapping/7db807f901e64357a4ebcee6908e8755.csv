The man is the former President of the United States, John F. Kennedy.  He says that he needs your help, and that this is no joke. ""It sounds like a joke."" you respond. ""It is a joke."" he replies. ""I thought so."" you say.  ""Who put you up to this?"" ""Nobody."" he says.

You roll your eyes, and take a deep breath, and speak again. ""Listen, you've got about ten seconds to tell me who you are, and who put you up to this crap.

There's important work to be done tonight. You've got a gig at the Kennedy Center, and you're rehearsing. You decided retirement was the perfect time to start a new career as a singer, and composer, and this evening is your debut.

At the time of the gig, a limo picks you up and drives you to the place. You've got a trace of the first night jitters, but you shake it off, mount the stage, and begin your rendition of ""My Way"". You think the Chairman of the Board would have been proud. It comes off great, and the audience roars with applause. You've knocked it out of the park, as usual.

""I am John F. Kennedy, sitting in front of my computer in the Oval Office."" You grit your teeth in frustration. ""You some kind of telemarketing spambot?"" His nonsensical replies are the sort of word salad you've learned to associate with 'customer service' or sales chatbots. You've had enough. You hang up the phone, and forget about it.

You're the retired former President of the United States, you have millions and millions in the bank, and you have better things to do with your time than deal with crank calls. There's important work to be done tonight. You've got a gig at the Kennedy Center, and you're rehearsing. You decided retirement was the perfect time to start a new career as a singer, and composer, and this evening is your debut.

At the time of the gig, a limo picks you up and drives you to the place. You've got a trace of the first night jitters, but you shake it off, mount the stage, and begin your rendition of ""My Way"". You think the Chairman of the Board would have been proud. It comes off great, and the audience roars with applause. You've knocked it out of the park, as usual.

You look towards the back of the crowd, and are stunned to see a familiar face. It's Jackie Kennedy, looking straight at you. A single tear rolls down her cheek",user,45,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1898,text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" You wonder what the heck this could be.  Some kind of prank? A sick joke? It seems stupid, and morbid. You suspect Biden, or maybe Harris. It's got to be someone with a sense of humor, though, so maybe it's even Trump. 

Sighing, you dial the number. It rings a few times, and a familiar voice answers. It's the voice of a man you haven't heard in years, but it's instantly recognizable. The man is the former President of the United States, John F. Kennedy.  He says that he needs your help, and that this is no joke. ""It sounds like a joke."" you respond. ""It is a joke."" he replies. ""I thought so."" you say.  ""Who put you up to this?"" ""Nobody."" he says.

You roll your eyes, and take a deep breath, and speak again. ""Listen, you've got about ten seconds to tell me who you are, and who put you up to this crap. I've still got access to the red phone, and the secret service, and this call is being traced even as we speak, so spill it, or you're gonna be in a whole heap of trouble.""
