""How can I make her fall in love with me?"" said the guy who was a shapeshifter. He has tried everything. Made himself look like a handsome billionaire, tried being nice, nice, nice. He also have tried being a famous musician, a successful businessman, and even tried being the guy next door. Nothing seem to have worked with this young lady that he has fallen in love with.

Her name was Amber, and she is a very beautiful young lady. She lived downtown the city of Los Angeles, California, and that's where she did her daily routine of work. She works in a little cafe, and she's always there at the same time; waiting for her co-workers to arrive.

The shapeshifter man, who goes by the name of Boris, is always there at the same time. He changes his appearance every time just so Amber wouldn't notice him being creepy. 

""I don't get it,"" said Boris to himself. ""Is she a lesbian? That can't be, I heard her talking about previous boyfriends with her coworker."" 

""What can I get you?"" asked Amber to Boris. ""The usual,"" he replied in a frustrated tone towards Amber.

""I'm sorry,"" said Amber, ""I can't really hear you, because I have an ear infection.""

Boris repeated himself, ""I said I want the usual, please.""

""But I haven't seen you before, sir."" said Amber. ""I've been a regular customer,"" said Boris in a rather rude manner.

""If you're a regular customer, then why haven't I seen you before?"" asked Amber.

""I'll get a coffee, and I'll tell you later. You clock out at 6, right?"" said Boris. 

""Yeah..."" said Amber who reluctantly accepted the invitation.

The two went to a park. Whatever the reason was, Boris have decided to just tell Amber that he is a shapeshifter. Amber did not believe him at first, but once she saw Boris change his appearance to match the guy's wallet that he found on the ground, and then back, she has believed him. Amber have been so impressed and intrigued that he agreed to Boris and went on a second date.

Her name was Amber, and she is a very beautiful young lady. She lived downtown the city of Los Angeles, California, and that's where she did her daily routine of work. She works in a little cafe, and she's always there at the same time; waiting for her co-workers to arrive.

The shapeshifter man, who goes by the name of Boris, is always there at the same time. He changes his appearance every time just so Amber wouldn't notice him being creepy. 

""I don't get it,"" said Boris to himself. ""Is she a lesbian? That can't be, I heard her talking about previous boyfriends with her coworker."" 

""What can I get you?"" asked Amber to Boris. ""The usual,"" he replied in a frustrated tone towards Amber.

""I'm sorry,"" said Amber, ""I can't really hear you, because I have an ear infection.""

Boris repeated himself, ""I said I want the usual, please.""

""But I haven't seen you before, sir."" said Amber. ""I've been a regular customer,"" said Boris in a rather rude manner.

""If you're a regular customer, then why haven't I seen you before?"" asked Amber.

""I'll get a coffee, and I'll tell you later. You clock out at 6, right?"" said Boris. 

""Yeah..."" said Amber who reluctantly accepted the invitation.

The two went to a park. Whatever the reason was, Boris have decided to just tell Amber that he is a shapeshifter. Amber did not believe him at first, but once she saw Boris change his appearance to match the guy's wallet that he found on the ground, and then back, she has believed him.
