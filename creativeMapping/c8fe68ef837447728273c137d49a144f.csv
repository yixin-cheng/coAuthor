But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. The aliens control the whole planet, and have for many years. But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world.

Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times.

Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders.

When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. The aliens control the whole planet, and have for many years. But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.

When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world.

They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.
 When she does, she is shocked to discover that they are not only ready and willing to help, they themselves have been trianing hard to take on the aliens on their own.

But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.
 When she does, she is shocked to discover that they are not only ready and willing to help, they themselves have been trianing hard to take on the aliens on their own.

The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.

But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world.

When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders.

Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.
 When she does, she is shocked to discover that they are not only ready and willing to help, they themselves have been trianing hard to take on the aliens on their own.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her.
