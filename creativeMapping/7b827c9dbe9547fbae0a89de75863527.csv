  Finally, in a cave in what had been Brazil, searchers found a small group of people.  There was a language barrier, but American's interviewing them determined that there had been a war between Russia and China.  Every country except the US had taken one side or the other, and in return all countries had been wiped out about 20 years earlier.  Since the US hadn't been involved, they were spared and had no idea what was going on.   

The US president called an emergency meeting to try and figure out what they should do.  It was a shock to find that the US was alone in the world except for small pockets of survivors.  He decided that he would keep searching and bring survivors together if they wanted, or leave them be if not.  He also started sending teams out figure out what natural resources the US could benefit from in the abandoned countries.  They looked for technologies that might have been discovered as well.  As this occurred, more survivors were found, especially on islands that hadn't been obvious during the war.

He also started sending teams out figure out what natural resources the US could benefit from in the abandoned countries.  They looked for technologies that might have been discovered as well.

The US president sent teams out to countries.  The envoy that went to Russia found buildings in rubble.  Animals had taken over the landscape.  Not one person was found.  The same was true in England. In France. In Australia they found kangaroos wandering cracked and ruined roads and kiwis nested in the few buildings that remained standing.

  Finally, in a cave in what had been Brazil, searchers found a small group of people.  There was a language barrier, but American's interviewing them determined that there had been a war between Russia and China.  Every country except the US had taken one side or the other, and in return all countries had been wiped out about 20 years earlier.  Since the US hadn't been involved, they were spared and had no idea what was going on.   

The US president called an emergency meeting to try and figure out what they should do.  It was a shock to find that the US was alone in the world except for small pockets of survivors.  He decided that he would keep searching and bring survivors together if they wanted, or leave them be if not.  He also started sending teams out figure out what natural resources the US could benefit from in the abandoned countries.  They looked for technologies that might have been discovered as well.  As this occurred, more survivors were found, especially on islands that hadn't been obvious during the war.  

Over the next few years, Americans had the opportunity to populate other countries.  This was good because during the period of isolation, the population had boomed.
