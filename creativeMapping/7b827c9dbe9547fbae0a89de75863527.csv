  Finally, in a cave in what had been Brazil, searchers found a small group of people.  There was a language barrier, but American's interviewing them determined that there had been a war between Russia and China.

The US president called an emergency meeting to try and figure out what they should do.  It was a shock to find that the US was alone in the world except for small pockets of survivors.  He decided that he would keep searching and bring survivors together if they wanted, or leave them be if not.  He also started sending teams out figure out what natural resources the US could benefit from in the abandoned countries.  They looked for technologies that might have been discovered as well.  As this occurred, more survivors were found, especially on islands that hadn't been obvious during the war.
