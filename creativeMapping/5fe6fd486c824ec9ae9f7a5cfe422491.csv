""Where did that voice come from?"" you wonder. There's no radio or phone nearby, and you're sitting by yourself in the garden.  Your mother usually never let you outside or out of her sight, but today, she was out visiting a friend She had locked the bedroom door, but being a clever girl, you knew how to get out, into the forbidden outdoors. 

Then you feel the bee on your shoulder, its tiny feet clinging to the fabric of your shirt. A thousand thoughts flash through your mind. ""If one touches your skin, you will die,"" your mother had warned. She had smashed any bee, keeping them away from landing on you.

 ""No"" The bee says. ""You are not allergic to bees. That is a lie your mother has told you.
She is a wasp, and she has lied to you all your life.
