JFK?
 As in the dead President John F Kennedy? What the heck is going on? You pick up the phone, and after a long wait you are connected to Lee Harvey Oswald. He wants to meet with you at Jack Ruby's Nightclub in Dallas. 
ou are a bit leery, but you go to the meeting.
 

Lee Harvey Oswald informs you that JFK needs your help. The Zombies are taking over the country and he needs you to stop them. Lee gives you a ""magic stick"" and tells you to give it a wave, and that will summon the Zombie-B-Gone. 

You go back to Washington D.C. and see that all of the statues are being replaced with Zombies! You use the magic stick, and wave it around.
 The Zombie-B-Gone is activated, and the zombies disappear! 
You've defeated the zombies and saved the Presidency.
 The zombies are gone, but you have a new job now. You must now save the world from the rise of zombies across the globe. 

You decide to start with a place in the middle of nowhere. You feel the zombies have been hiding in this town, and you must investigate. As you enter the town, it's apparent that something is wrong. There are no humans walking around and all of the cars have been abandoned. You see a newspaper lying on the ground with ""This town is dead..."" printed in bold. 

Suddenly, the Zombies come out of nowhere! You fight off wave after wave of zombies, but you are outnumbered. Lee Harvey Oswald comes to your aid with the Zombie-B-Gone. You all wave the magic sticks in unison, and the zombies disappear! 

The zombies have been defeated, but you've discovered that they are hiding out in a town in Kansas. You jump in the Zombie-B-Gone truck and head off to Kansas. 

You arrive in Kansas to find that the townspeople have all been turned into zombies! You and Lee go to investigate, but the zombies spot you before you can get a good look around. The zombies come at you, and there are so many of them! It looks like you are going to be overwhelmed, but Lee comes to your rescue yet again with the magic stick.

Lee Harvey Oswald informs you that JFK needs your help. The Zombies are taking over the country and he needs you to stop them. Lee gives you a ""magic stick"" and tells you to give it a wave, and that will summon the Zombie-B-Gone.

ou are a bit leery, but you go to the meeting.
 

Lee Harvey Oswald informs you that JFK needs your help. The Zombies are taking over the country and he needs you to stop them. Lee gives you a ""magic stick"" and tells you to give it a wave, and that will summon the Zombie-B-Gone. 

You go back to Washington D.C. and see that all of the statues are being replaced with Zombies! You use the magic stick, and wave it around.
 The Zombie-B-Gone is activated, and the zombies disappear! 
You've defeated the zombies and saved the Presidency.
 The zombies are gone, but you have a new job now. You must now save the world from the rise of zombies across the globe. 

You decide to start with a place in the middle of nowhere. You feel the zombies have been hiding in this town, and you must investigate. As you enter the town, it's apparent that something is wrong. There are no humans walking around and all of the cars have been abandoned. You see a newspaper lying on the ground with ""This town is dead..."" printed in bold. 

Suddenly, the Zombies come out of nowhere! You fight off wave after wave of zombies, but you are outnumbered. Lee Harvey Oswald comes to your aid with the Zombie-B-Gone. You all wave the magic sticks in unison, and the zombies disappear! 

The zombies have been defeated, but you've discovered that they are hiding out in a town in Kansas. You jump in the Zombie-B-Gone truck and head off to Kansas. 

You arrive in Kansas to find that the townspeople have all been turned into zombies! You and Lee go to investigate, but the zombies spot you before you can get a good look around. The zombies come at you, and there are so many of them! It looks like you are going to be overwhelmed, but Lee comes to your rescue yet again with the magic stick. 
The zombies are gone, but you know that there must be a source of the zombie epidemic...
 
You head off to the center of the country and find a facility called ""The Center for Disease Control"". 
ou enter the facility and find out that a company called ""Military Industrial Pharmaceuticals"" has been doing experiments with a chemical called Z-
