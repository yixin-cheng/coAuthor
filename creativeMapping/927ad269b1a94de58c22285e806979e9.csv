JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world.

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. ",user,50,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach.

She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun.

You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on.

So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure.

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on.

You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on.

 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on.

 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" When you call the number that's listed, JFK answers the phone. You ask him, ""What do you mean, John?"" JFK responds, ""Barry, you're in luck. As it turns out, the real job is to relax and be a great dad to Sasha and Malia."" You respond, ""John, of course I am enjoying retirement. So what are you talking about?""

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers.

 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet.

If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on.

 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach.

You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment. You could never imagine such a fun afternoon with Michelle and you have JFK to thank for all of this. It's really quite relaxing to be at the beach and to have your wife all to yourself.

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" When you call the number that's listed, JFK answers the phone. You ask him, ""What do you mean, John?"" JFK responds, ""Barry, you're in luck. As it turns out, the real job is to relax and be a great dad to Sasha and Malia."" You respond, ""John, of course I am enjoying retirement. So what are you talking about?""

JFK sighs into the phone. ""Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break. Do you think you can do that?""

You are grateful that JFK has given you strict instructions to relax, because you were getting a little too stressed over the state of the world. In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. 
Your plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters.
 Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. 
She asks what kind of fun you mean.
 You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. 
You shrug your shoulders, and agree.
 She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. 
So you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly.
 She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment. You could never imagine such a fun afternoon with Michelle and you have JFK to thank for all of this. It's really quite relaxing to be at the beach and to have your wife all to yourself.
