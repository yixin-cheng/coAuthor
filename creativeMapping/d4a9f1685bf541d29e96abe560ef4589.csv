 Large, needlelike stones stood around the ring, focusing the Mana's flow.   The energy would be focused into a single person, who would become the savior of humanity. 

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.
 ""The time has come,"" he said. ""The Mana has chosen its vessel.""

 Large, needlelike stones stood around the ring, focusing the Mana's flow.   The energy would be focused into a single person, who would become the savior of humanity. 

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.

The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.
