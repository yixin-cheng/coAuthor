The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.
