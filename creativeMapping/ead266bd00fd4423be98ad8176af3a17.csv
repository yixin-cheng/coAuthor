A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank.

And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made.

But the world didn't listen.

The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. WHich was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappear",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

The world panicked again.

 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank.

 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank.

 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there.

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves.""

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too.

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous.

 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves.""

 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank.

 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous.

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there.

 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves.""

It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves.""

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made.

But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

text-delete,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there.

And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves.""

text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. 

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. 

The mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem? It finds a way to turn a problem into money. 

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there. Game show even popped up, and of course reality shows. 
And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers.""

And the mugs were everywhere.
 People kept trying to figure out the cause. Mostly so that they could get the same things to happen with other mugs. There was a lot of money to be made. Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.

 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came.

 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves.""

Social workers and other activists tried to point out the harm this was doing to kids - after all parents stopped parenting to do the right thing and started picking their actions based on what they thought would increase their rank. 
But the world didn't listen.
 Until one day all of the mugs disappeared. 
The world panicked.
 There was a lot of finger pointing, and a lot of blame. And a lot of conspiracy theories. Some people hoped that families would go back to normal, but they didn't. Now companies rose up, ranking all the dads as best they could. And the world started to get even worse.

And then dads started to disappear too. 
The world panicked again.
 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to.

At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out.

So there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them.

A company called Dad Rankings Inc. started selling the mugs again. This time with a marketing campaign that said ""You can't hide from the numbers."" And a clever social media presence that made increasing your rank a game. Sometimes it was just pure ranking. Sometimes it was how many ranks you could increase - bad dads had the advantage there.
