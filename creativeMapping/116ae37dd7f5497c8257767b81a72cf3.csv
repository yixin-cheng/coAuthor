Yes hello, Barak, it's JFK, yes I know, just listen.  I realize you, and everyone else thinks I'm dead. It was all preplanned... so never mind all that. I had little say in the matter, they made it clear in Dallas in '63 that I WOULD be killed if I didn't play ball, so here we are. I AM getting too old for this, and it's time for you to step up. See There is another planet, just outside our solar system. It's called Ganon 45.  I run things there, it's like a parallel to here. There is a yin and yang to things, you see. You're expertise is needed there, Things are exactly 40 years behind time there in relation to Earth.  Are you packed?
No, I answer, I'm not.  OK, get your necessities and we'll supply you with anything else you want/need. The world, or Ganon is yours. Please come ahead. You CAN say no, but things will end very badly for you and your family if you do, you'll alter the time/space continuum, necessitating a reset, and we don't want that.

Yes hello, Barak, it's JFK, yes I know, just listen.  I realize you, and everyone else thinks I'm dead. It was all preplanned... so never mind all that.

No, I answer, I'm not.  OK, get your necessities and we'll supply you with anything else you want/need. The world, or Ganon is yours. Please come ahead. You CAN say no, but things will end very badly for you and your family if you do, you'll alter the time/space continuum, necessitating a reset, and we don't want that.

Forget packing bags, I'm going to call the phone number now, first. Ok, It's ringing. Wait, someone's voice - Hello? 
Yes hello, Barak, it's JFK, yes I know, just listen.  I realize you, and everyone else thinks I'm dead. It was all preplanned... so never mind all that. I had little say in the matter, they made it clear in Dallas in '63 that I WOULD be killed if I didn't play ball, so here we are. I AM getting too old for this, and it's time for you to step up. See There is another planet, just outside our solar system. It's called Ganon 45.  I run things there, it's like a parallel to here. There is a yin and yang to things, you see. You're expertise is needed there, Things are exactly 40 years behind time there in relation to Earth.  Are you packed?
No, I answer, I'm not.  OK, get your necessities and we'll supply you with anything else you want/need. The world, or Ganon is yours. Please come ahead. You CAN say no, but things will end very badly for you and your family if you do, you'll alter the time/space continuum, necessitating a reset, and we don't want that.

I say ok, sit stunned, and begin grabbing a few items. There are men there with Secret Service, they seem to have things all sorted. I'm told to sit in the back of a black SUV, and we're off. I'm dazed, wondering what will next happen. I haven't even said goodbye to my wife, for how long, I had no idea.  We were going to an air base off of Virginia's coast, I was told.  What in the heck? Ok. So we ride there in relative silence, my ""bodyguards"" seem mute. I'm not sure what to say, so I don't say anything.

We get to the gates, which open immediately, and I find myself ushered in towards what appears to be an airfield. It can't be, it just can't. But it is. It's a glowing saucer shaped craft, hovering over the ground, green men wait on either side of the door lifting toward the craft, I grab my bag, and step up, going into another world",user,47,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2634,text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

What the fudge? Really, what the heck can this be about. I always thought, being retired meant I'd have AT LEAST SOME time for myself? And furthermore, how the heck did someone get into my room? I have secret service here, after all. That's crazy. And Wait, surely this isn't THE JFK, the dead one? Nope, it couldn't be, I've seen the file myself, Kennedy was definitely killed, not alive, even if he was... well, he'd be what, pushing a hundred? Nah, no way. He, besides suffering an assassination, had Addison's disease, impossible to survive this long.
