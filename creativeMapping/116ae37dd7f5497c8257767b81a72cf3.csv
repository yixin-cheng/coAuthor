What the fudge? Really, what the heck can this be about. I always thought, being retired meant I'd have AT LEAST SOME time for myself? And furthermore, how the heck did someone get into my room?

Yes hello, Barak, it's JFK, yes I know, just listen.  I realize you, and everyone else thinks I'm dead. It was all preplanned... so never mind all that. I had little say in the matter, they made it clear in Dallas in '63 that I WOULD be killed if I didn't play ball, so here we are. I AM getting too old for this, and it's time for you to step up.

No, I answer, I'm not.  OK, get your necessities and we'll supply you with anything else you want/need. The world, or Ganon is yours. Please come ahead.

What the fudge? Really, what the heck can this be about. I always thought, being retired meant I'd have AT LEAST SOME time for myself? And furthermore, how the heck did someone get into my room?

Yes hello, Barak, it's JFK, yes I know, just listen.  I realize you, and everyone else thinks I'm dead. It was all preplanned... so never mind all that. I had little say in the matter, they made it clear in Dallas in '63 that I WOULD be killed if I didn't play ball, so here we are. I AM getting too old for this, and it's time for you to step up.

No, I answer, I'm not.  OK, get your necessities and we'll supply you with anything else you want/need. The world, or Ganon is yours. Please come ahead. You CAN say no, but things will end very badly for you and your family if you do, you'll alter the time/space continuum, necessitating a reset, and we don't want that.

What the fudge? Really, what the heck can this be about. I always thought, being retired meant I'd have AT LEAST SOME time for myself? And furthermore, how the heck did someone get into my room?

Forget packing bags, I'm going to call the phone number now, first. Ok, It's ringing. Wait, someone's voice - Hello? 
Yes hello, Barak, it's JFK, yes I know, just listen.  I realize you, and everyone else thinks I'm dead. It was all preplanned... so never mind all that.

No, I answer, I'm not.  OK, get your necessities and we'll supply you with anything else you want/need. The world, or Ganon is yours. Please come ahead. You CAN say no, but things will end very badly for you and your family if you do, you'll alter the time/space continuum, necessitating a reset, and we don't want that.

I say ok, sit stunned, and begin grabbing a few items. There are men there with Secret Service, they seem to have things all sorted. I'm told to sit in the back of a black SUV, and we're off.
