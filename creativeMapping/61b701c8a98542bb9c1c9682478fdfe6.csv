You have been expecting this letter. Not this soon, but you have been expecting it none the less. You know what you must do. You go into your secret basement room, and pull on a book. When you do, a secret wall opens up, and you go inside. 
You are in a room with a desk, a phone, and a computer.
 Also in the middle of the room is a strange small platform. You turn on the computer, pick up the phone, press the send button, then turn the chair around. The platform on the floor glows a strange blue color. You step onto it and it begins to rise. The world around you begins to shimmer, as you start to travel back in time.
You arrive in a strange room with a strange looking man.
 The man takes off his hood, and you recognize him as JFK. He says, ""Welcome to the past, Barack. Way in the past. The Jurassic era as a matter of fact.""  
""I'm here to stop the extinction of the dinosaurs?""
 you say. ""No"" he says. ""You are here to help me make sure the extinction of the dinosaurs happen. Otherwise, we will not have a world to live in. As you know, it takes two people to press the button to bring the meteor. Then you can go home."" ""I'm ready."" you said.
