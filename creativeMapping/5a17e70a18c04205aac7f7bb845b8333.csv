Meanwhile, Matt Damon is being held captive by an alien who saw him in the movie The Martian, and decided he'd be a good addition to his collection. He's wanted a human for a long time, and Matt Damon seems to be a particularly interesting specimen. He's being held in a cage, and is being fed a steady diet of potatoes, which he hates. It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

They don't know this, but the alien attempted to lure Matt Damon with it, and once that failed, resorted to the brute force tactic of a stun ray. The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

It just so happens, that he's kidnapped once every few years, and the government has a secret agency dedicated to bringing him back. They're called the Men in Black, and they're the best in the business. The moment Damon isn't where the telemetric scanner says he should be for a period of more than 2 minutes, an alarm goes off, and the MIB are called in. Jets are scrambled, alert status is activated, and the best agents are sent to the scene.

Meanwhile, Matt Damon is being held captive by an alien who saw him in the movie The Martian, and decided he'd be a good addition to his collection. He's wanted a human for a long time, and Matt Damon seems to be a particularly interesting specimen. He's being held in a cage, and is being fed a steady diet of potatoes, which he hates. It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

Back on Earth, the MIB have arrived at the scene, and are looking for clues. One agent finds something. It's a potato. They don't know this, but the alien attempted to lure Matt Damon with it, and once that failed, resorted to the brute force tactic of a stun ray. The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

Meanwhile, the situation on the spaceship is deteriorating. The alien finds that Matt Damon is a terrible conversationalist, and is getting bored. He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

Meanwhile, Matt Damon is being held captive by an alien who saw him in the movie The Martian, and decided he'd be a good addition to his collection. He's wanted a human for a long time, and Matt Damon seems to be a particularly interesting specimen. He's being held in a cage, and is being fed a steady diet of potatoes, which he hates. It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

Meanwhile, the situation on the spaceship is deteriorating. The alien finds that Matt Damon is a terrible conversationalist, and is getting bored. He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

At their secret base on Earth, the MIB have managed to track the alien ship to a position in low orbit. They launch a spacecraft to board the ship, and begin the mission to rescue Matt Damon.

It just so happens, that he's kidnapped once every few years, and the government has a secret agency dedicated to bringing him back. They're called the Men in Black, and they're the best in the business. The moment Damon isn't where the telemetric scanner says he should be for a period of more than 2 minutes, an alarm goes off, and the MIB are called in. Jets are scrambled, alert status is activated, and the best agents are sent to the scene.

Meanwhile, Matt Damon is being held captive by an alien who saw him in the movie The Martian, and decided he'd be a good addition to his collection. He's wanted a human for a long time, and Matt Damon seems to be a particularly interesting specimen. He's being held in a cage, and is being fed a steady diet of potatoes, which he hates. It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

Back on Earth, the MIB have arrived at the scene, and are looking for clues. One agent finds something. It's a potato. They don't know this, but the alien attempted to lure Matt Damon with it, and once that failed, resorted to the brute force tactic of a stun ray. The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

Meanwhile, the situation on the spaceship is deteriorating. The alien finds that Matt Damon is a terrible conversationalist, and is getting bored. He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

At their secret base on Earth, the MIB have managed to track the alien ship to a position in low orbit. They launch a spacecraft to board the ship, and begin the mission to rescue Matt Damon. Once aboard, the alien greets them. He says he's happy to see them, and that he's glad to be rid of Matt Damon. The agents decide to accept the situation, and let the alien go.

He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

At their secret base on Earth, the MIB have managed to track the alien ship to a position in low orbit. They launch a spacecraft to board the ship, and begin the mission to rescue Matt Damon. Once aboard, the alien greets them. He says he's happy to see them, and that he's glad to be rid of Matt Damon. The agents decide to accept the situation, and let the alien go.

The moment Damon isn't where the telemetric scanner says he should be for a period of more than 2 minutes, an alarm goes off, and the MIB are called in. Jets are scrambled, alert status is activated, and the best agents are sent to the scene.

Meanwhile, Matt Damon is being held captive by an alien who saw him in the movie The Martian, and decided he'd be a good addition to his collection. He's wanted a human for a long time, and Matt Damon seems to be a particularly interesting specimen. He's being held in a cage, and is being fed a steady diet of potatoes, which he hates. It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

Back on Earth, the MIB have arrived at the scene, and are looking for clues. One agent finds something. It's a potato. They don't know this, but the alien attempted to lure Matt Damon with it, and once that failed, resorted to the brute force tactic of a stun ray. The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

Meanwhile, the situation on the spaceship is deteriorating. The alien finds that Matt Damon is a terrible conversationalist, and is getting bored. He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

At their secret base on Earth, the MIB have managed to track the alien ship to a position in low orbit. They launch a spacecraft to board the ship, and begin the mission to rescue Matt Damon. Once aboard, the alien greets them. He says he's happy to see them, and that he's glad to be rid of Matt Damon. The agents decide to accept the situation, and let the alien go.

It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

Back on Earth, the MIB have arrived at the scene, and are looking for clues. One agent finds something. It's a potato. They don't know this, but the alien attempted to lure Matt Damon with it, and once that failed, resorted to the brute force tactic of a stun ray. The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

Meanwhile, the situation on the spaceship is deteriorating. The alien finds that Matt Damon is a terrible conversationalist, and is getting bored. He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

At their secret base on Earth, the MIB have managed to track the alien ship to a position in low orbit. They launch a spacecraft to board the ship, and begin the mission to rescue Matt Damon. Once aboard, the alien greets them. He says he's happy to see them, and that he's glad to be rid of Matt Damon. The agents decide to accept the situation, and let the alien go.
