Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 75. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised.

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 50 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 75. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 50 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 75. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 50 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough.

When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 8. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 50 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research.

When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make",user,34,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 59 y",user,34,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 50 years.

Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 50 years. The death would be absolutely excruciating. The mental pain would be horrible too. The anxiety and thought of that would haunt a person's life all the way up until that terrible deathly day.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 50 years. The death would be absolutely excruciating. The mental pain would be horrible too. The anxiety and thought of that would haunt a person's life all the way up until that terrible deathly day.

Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones.

But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough.

The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 50 years. The death would be absolutely excruciating. The mental pain would be horrible too. The anxiety and thought of that would haunt a person's life all the way up until that terrible deathly day.

But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it.

The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 50 years. The death would be absolutely excruciating. The mental pain would be horrible too. The anxiety and thought of that would haunt a person's life all the way up until that terrible deathly day.
