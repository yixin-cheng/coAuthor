The meeting goes pretty well but for the first time in a long time you realize that the United States is no longer the most powerful country or nation in the world.

You have another meeting with the coalition and try to create an agreement with them. There will be no conflicts and the United States will stick to their own country. They don't want to get involved in any of the matters that the Coalition are involved in. The agreement is signed. The United States and the Coalition will not get involved in any internal conflicts and will stay neutral related to each other.

You have another meeting with the coalition and try to create an agreement with them. There will be no conflicts and the United States will stick to their own country. They don't want to get involved in any of the matters that the Coalition are involved in. The agreement is signed.
