 That is what was agreed upon and what has caused us to send a crew into space. The crew ended up being a rag tag team that was gung-ho on getting him back. They went into space with cameras so we could watch every moment. It was like watching the OJ trial as no one would miss a moment of it.

 He wasn't surprised upon their arrival. He knew they would rescue him since he is the one and only Matt Damon. They shot through any alien in the way to clear a path and lead him back to the space ship. It seemed odd how smoothly it had gone, but this crew weren't ones to really overthink things.

 He made more movies and everyone was happy. He then ended up running for President. He hadn't had any political inclinations before but people were happy to vote for him. He ended up winning by a landslide. ",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
