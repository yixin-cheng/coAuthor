In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You swallow and try not to think too hard about how uncanny your life has become. ""What's this about?"" you finally manage to ask.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You swallow and try not to think too hard about how uncanny your life has become. ""What's this about?"" you finally manage to ask.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.

Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You swallow and try not to think too hard about how uncanny your life has become. ""What's this about?"" you finally manage to ask. ""What's the 'real job' you wanted me here for?""

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You swallow and try not to think too hard about how uncanny your life has become. ""What's this about?"" you finally manage to ask. ""What's the 'real job' you wanted me here for?""

John leans forward and grins. ""See that facility down there?"" he asks, gesturing out the window. Growing closer, you can indeed see the growing shape of a massive concrete structure.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.

It sort of reminds you of that scene from The Avengers.

You turn to look at JFK himself, the man who invited you abroad. He looks pristine, wearing a very fashionable and modern slim cut suit. If you didn't know any better, you might think he were a young guy fresh out of college, eager to start his first day at a career desk job.

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You swallow and try not to think too hard about how uncanny your life has become. ""What's this about?"" you finally manage to ask. ""What's the 'real job' you wanted me here for?""

John leans forward and grins. ""See that facility down there?"" he asks, gesturing out the window. Growing icloser, you can indeed see the growing shape of a massive concrete structure.

""That's where we're learning how to conquer death.""

He catches you staring and offers you a charming smile. The others in the cabin follow suit, until a good dozen pair of very famous eyes are fixed on you.

""You look well, Barack,"" comments John. From across the aisle, Reagan nods in agreement.

You swallow and try not to think too hard about how uncanny your life has become. ""What's this about?"" you finally manage to ask. ""What's the 'real job' you wanted me here for?""

John leans forward and grins. ""See that facility down there?"" he asks, gesturing out the window. Growing increasingly closer, you can indeed see the growing shape of a massive concrete structure.

""That's where we're learning how to conquer death.""
The plane lands.

It's not really like it's your first time ever getting a strange note. In fact, it's one of the hazards of being the former President of the United States--pretty much everybody wants to send you notes. Notes about foreign policy, notes about blackmail, notes with interesting facts on them about the number of people who died by lawnmower in 2004.

JFK though? As far as you've ever been aware, Former President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead. People saw him die. A lot of people, in fact.

Your head starts to ache and for a moment you wonder if you're about to go the way of JFK.

But you're no coward and you're always ready for the challenge of new responsibilities. This one is no exception. Steeling your nerves, you pull your phone out of your pocket and dial the number on the note.
A few hours later, you're io a plane with a bunch of other former Presidents.: there's a lady from the Truman administration, who doesn't seem to have aged at all; there's a man from Lincoln's administration, who resembles a giant bear; there's a man from Eisenhower's administration, who seems to be missing an arm; even Nixon himself is there, grumpy-faced and slouching.
