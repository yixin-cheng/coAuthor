The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people.

Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up.

suggestion-get,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people. Those who created the drug are now reversing in age. With that reversal comes loss of knowledge and the skills that had made them great scientists. Those who took the drug are also reversing in age with no knowledge of what is happening and unable to influence with their life.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people. Those who created the drug are now reversing in age. With that reversal comes loss of knowledge and the skills that had made them great scientists. Those who took the drug are also reversing in age with no knowledge of what is happening and unable to influence with their life.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people.

Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

Those who took the drug are also reversing in age with no knowledge of what is happening and unable to influence with their life.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

 Frantic, you continue to search online for an answer to what is going on. Suddenly, you hear an ice cream truck going by in the neighborhood. You grab your purse and rush outside to flag it down. When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sa",user,34,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Those who created the drug are now reversing in age. With that reversal comes loss of knowledge and the skills that had made them great scientists.

Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle.

Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

 Frantic, you continue to search online for an answer to what is going on. Suddenly, you hear an ice cream truck going by in the neighborhood. You grab your purse and rush outside to flag it down. When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life. 
As the sun disappears below the horizon, you know your time has run out.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people. Those who created the drug are now reversing in age. With that reversal comes loss of knowledge and the skills that had made them great scientists. Those who took the drug are also reversing in age with no knowledge of what is happening and unable to influence with their life.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

 Frantic, you continue to search online for an answer to what is going on. Suddenly, you hear an ice cream truck going by in the neighborhood. You grab your purse and rush outside to flag it down. When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

 Frantic, you continue to search online for an answer to what is going on. Suddenly, you hear an ice cream truck going by in the neighborhood. You grab your purse and rush outside to flag it down. When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life. 
As the sun disappears below the horizon, you know your time has run out.

Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

 Frantic, you continue to search online for an answer to what is going on. Suddenly, you hear an ice cream truck going by in the neighborhood. You grab your purse and rush outside to flag it down. When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life. 
As the sun disappears below the horizon, you know your time has run out.

Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

 Frantic, you continue to search online for an answer to what is going on. Suddenly, you hear an ice cream truck going by in the neighborhood. You grab your purse and rush outside to flag it down. When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life.

When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life. 
As the sun disappears below the horizon, you know your time has run out.

The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror.

When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life.

The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people.

Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life.

The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people. Those who created the drug are now reversing in age. With that reversal comes loss of knowledge and the skills that had made them great scientists.

You realize that it is up to you and the Lost Generation to find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, at 85, your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life.

The side effects for everyone that took the medication are stunning, to say the least. Instead of staying the same age, people are getting younger.  The pharmaceutical companies are racing to figure out what has gone wrong with their miracle cure for aging. The horror and reality of the situation is setting in for too many people. Those who created the drug are now reversing in age. With that reversal comes loss of knowledge and the skills that had made them great scientists.

Deciding to take a calculated risk that you will be able to find a way to stop the age reversal, you take the medication. Knowing you need to get younger in a very short amount of time, you decide to take 20 times the recommended dose. Unsure if this has been the right thing to do, you crawl wearily into bed to rest and wait for the dawn of the next day.

The next morning you wake up and literally jump out of bed. Feeling spry and healthy, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to the core, you see the 46 year old version of yourself staring back at you.  In only 12 hours you have reversed half a lifetime. You hurry to your computer and fire it up. Your mind is focused and working better than it has, quite literally, in decades. You gather up all the research from the internet on the medication. Your hand fly across the keyboard as you scan hundreds of scientific journals and files trying to solve the side effect of reverse aging.  As noon approaches, you decide to get something to eat. Passing the hall mirror, you are terrified to see that you appear to be only 25. Time has slipped away too quickly. You are living your life in hours instead of days.

When the driver pulls over, he asks ""What can I get for you young lady?"" You reach for the money in your purse and ask for a sponge bob popsicle. When you hand the driver the cash, you notice the hand of a small child reaching out from your body. Sadly, you take your popsicle and sit on the sidewalk. The sun is beginning to set in the sky and on your life. 
As the sun disappears below the horizon, you know your time has run out.
 Licking the last bit of ice cream from the stick, you are grateful to have one last small joy in life before it was over.",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
