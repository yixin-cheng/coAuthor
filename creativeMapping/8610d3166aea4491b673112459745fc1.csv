hi Mana Knights, have risen a group of people with the ability to wield Mana, and the fight to reclaim
 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  

You have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. Earth is the element of strength and power.

hi Mana Knights, have risen a group of people with the ability to wield Mana, and the fight to reclaim
 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  

You have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. Earth is the element of strength and power.
  Water is fluid and agile.  Wind is high and mighty.

hi Mana Knights, have risen a group of people with the ability to wield Mana, and the fight to reclaim
 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.

 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  

You have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. Earth is the element of strength and power.
  Water is fluid and agile.  Wind is high and mighty.  Fire is quick and energetic. You can see yourself in each element. 

How will you ever choose one elem?

hi Mana Knights, have risen a group of people with the ability to wield Mana, and the fight to reclaim
 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  

You have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. Earth is the element of strength and power.
  Water is fluid and agile.  Wind is high and mighty.  Fire is quick and energetic. You can see yourself in each element.

hi Mana Knights, have risen a group of people with the ability to wield Mana, and the fight to reclaim
 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  

You have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. Earth is the element of strength and power.
  Water is fluid and agile.  Wind is high and mighty.  Fire is quick and energetic. You can see yourself in each element. 

You must dedicate one element as your speciality, butHow will you ever choose one?
