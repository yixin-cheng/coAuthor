text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm not goin' near that house. 
The wolf went to the 91st little pig's house, which was made of straw.
 The wolf knocked on the door, which immediately caused the entire straw house to collapse, leaving only the door left standing. The wolf walked in, ate the pig, and went to sleep.  In the morning, the wolf got up.   He was feeling pretty full, so he decided to go to the 92nd little pig's house and eat him. Then he remembered the home was made of uranium. So he went to the 93rd little pig's house, which was made of wood.   He knocked on the door, and the entire house collapsed, leaving only the door standing. The wolf shrugged. He walked in, ate the pig, and went to sleep. In the morning, the wolf got up. ""I'm hungry,"" said the wolf. ""I think I'll go to the 94th little pig's house."" The wolf got to the end of the street. There was no 94th house. In fact, the wolf wasn't certain how many pigs there were. He was hungry, and he was angry. He turned around and started to walk towards the 92nd little pig's house.   But then he remembered that the house was made of uranium. He figured the only way he could eat the pig would be if the pig came out of the house. He would have to trick the pig into meeting him somewhere. The wolf walked down the street. He took out his phone and dialed the little pig's uranium house. There was no answer. The call was forwarded to an answering service.  ""If you would like to leave a message, press 1. If you would like to make an appointment with pig, press 2."" The wolf pressed 2. ""Please hold.""  Down the street, wolf could see the uranium house suddenly light up with multicolored lights. The wolf was confused. He could hear music and laughter coming from the house. He was so curious, he began walking closer to the house. Maybe it was a party.   The wolf walked up to the front door.
