""How did they get away with this? It was never even a consideration that we not go into isolation!"" a Major yells in reply.

A young, yet firm, voice speaks up ""Yes, you were fooled. But, our priorities should be  in communicating that we aren't a threat to the other leaders now that we are back.
""What do you mean?"" the President asks.
 

""We always knew that the isolation would end today, they may have realized the world was better off without us"" the young woman begins to explain, but is quickly drowned out by sirens going off.

The President swings his head around while yelling ""SITREP!!"" The heads of the military turn quickly to the screen showing a nuclear missile launching into orbit with a growing fiery tail behind it. 

""They planned this!"" the President screams ""they wanted to punish us!"" 
""No, they wanted to warn us,"" the woman replies as she faces away from the screen, her face exposed.
 ""We have to contact the other leaders now before this has gone too far""

The president who is now red in the face pushes the woman out of the chair and grabs the red phone. He dials a number before throwing the phone back down. 
""It's too late. It's all too late"" as he points to the monitor a new series of missiles show on the screen. 
""Our selfishness and narcissism, our pride and arrogance... it has always been our downfall""
An unbearably loud droning sound begins to drown out the words of the President.   The sound continues to grow louder and more discordant until it is eventually too loud to handle.  The bombs keep coming and keep exploding. The Vice President begins screaming ""It's too late, we're all too late!""


The young woman picks herself up from the floor and says under her breathe, 

""It's always been too late. Mission Accomplished""

""How did they get away with this? It was never even a consideration that we not go into isolation!"" a Major yells in reply.

A young, yet firm, voice speaks up ""Yes, you were fooled. But, our priorities should be  in communicating that we aren't a threat to the other leaders now that we are back.
""What do you mean?"" the President asks.
 

""We always knew that the isolation would end today, they may have realized the world was better off without us"" the young woman begins to explain, but is quickly drowned out by sirens going off.

The President swings his head around while yelling ""SITREP!!"" The heads of the military turn quickly to the screen showing a nuclear missile launching into orbit with a growing fiery tail behind it. 

""They planned this!"" the President screams ""they wanted to punish us!"" 
""No, they wanted to warn us,"" the woman replies as she faces away from the screen, her face exposed.
 ""We have to contact the other leaders now before this has gone too far""

The president who is now red in the face pushes the woman out of the chair and grabs the red phone. He dials a number before throwing the phone back down. 
""It's too late. It's all too late"" as he points to the monitor a new series of missiles show on the screen. 
""Our selfishness and narcissism, our pride and arrogance... it has always been our downfall""
An unbearably loud droning sound begins to drown out the words of the President.   The sound continues to grow louder and more discordant until it is eventually too loud to handle.  The bombs keep coming and keep exploding. The Vice President begins screaming ""It's too late, we're all too late!""


The young woman picks herself up from the floor and says under her breathe,
