 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered.

 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants.

 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height.

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. Th",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain.

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain.

 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hol

 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain.

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height.

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour.

The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will h

The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the members within i

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the members within it.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the members within it. He was seen as a hero. He saved hu
