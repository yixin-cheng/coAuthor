 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kid",user,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world toda",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"".

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"".

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"".

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again.

I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own.

To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads.

I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"".

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher.

To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic. But the ""best"" dad. My god, this has to be some sort of super human, or higher power. I want to be like this, but i dont want to be perfect.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads.

Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic.

To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.

This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic. But the ""best"" dad. My god, this has to be some sort of super human, or higher power. I want to be like this, but i dont want to be perfect. Nobody is perfect, so to try and act perfect is not realistic to kids. Showing your faults and showing how you fall down sometimes is so important. Maybe i deserve to be on this list? Not because i am a perfect dad, but simply because i give my best effort. I am ok with failing as long as i do my best. If i do my best, than i have no regrets.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me.

To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic. But the ""best"" dad. My god, this has to be some sort of super human, or higher power. I want to be like this, but i dont want to be perfect. Nobody is perfect, so to try and act perfect is not realistic to kids. Showing your faults and showing how you fall down sometimes is so important. Maybe i deserve to be on this list?

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family.

 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own.

To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic. But the ""best"" dad. My god, this has to be some sort of super human, or higher power. I want to be like this, but i dont want to be perfect. Nobody is perfect, so to try and act perfect is not realistic to kids. Showing your faults and showing how you fall down sometimes is so important. Maybe i deserve to be on this list? Not because i am a perfect dad, but simply because i give my best effort. I am ok with failing as long as i do my best. If i do my best, than i have no regrets. Regrets in life are like an illness. I dont want them. J",user,47,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads.

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"".
