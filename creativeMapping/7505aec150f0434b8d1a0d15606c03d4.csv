It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.

She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.

JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.   JFK leads a group of former presidents that work in the shadows to eliminate threats to the United States and the world.   It was a secret group called the ""C-Team"" and no one knows about them except for the former presidents and those they protect.  The C-Team deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats.

After I read the letter, I packed my suitcase.   Michelle was still in bed sleeping.  I woke her up and told her ""it's time"".  She knew about the C-Team as well.  She wished me luck and said that she would take care of the kids.  I called the number JFK left on the letter.  The person on the other end said that a helicopter would land in my back yard to pick me up.  The helicopter was on the scene in 30 minutes.  
The helicopter landed in my back yard, and two heavily armed  roopers escorted me to the chopper.
  I asked the pilot where we would be going.  He said space.  I laughed until two rocket engines appeared beneath the helicopter.  The helicopter pilots sealed off the compartment we were in and fired up the engines.  I am not sure where this rocket technology came from, but it was extremely powerful.  We had flown past the International Space Station in a manner of minutes.

It has been years since JFK, THE JFK, had contacted me.  He first contacted me after I was sworn in as president during my first term.
