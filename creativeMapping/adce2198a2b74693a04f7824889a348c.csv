It would also be pretty cool to watch the main character of a movie reincarnate as you would essentially get to see all of their lives in one movie. 

Reincarnation overall is a very conceptual idea that has roots in ancient culture. I believe this movie would be a great way to get people thinking about the idea of reincarnation. Most ancient cultures had at least some beliefs that a person would come back after death. This movie would be a great way to show how the idea of reincarnation has impacted the culture in general. In a way, it would help people wrap their heads around the concept and possibly learn how it has been viewed throughout history. I think that this movie would be very popular and would be an interesting concept to watch.
