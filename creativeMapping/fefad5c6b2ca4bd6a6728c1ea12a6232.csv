All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.

He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.

The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him.

As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not.

The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is.

He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.

He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.

The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires. 

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god.

He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon.

All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than th is promoted.",user,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The ali",user,31,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.

The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated

All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own.

He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own.

He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.

They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.

 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own.

All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself.

 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not.

He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store.

The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed.

All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth.

As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not.

 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for.

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution.

The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.

The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution.

The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not.

 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store.

The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him.

As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution.

The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution.

text-delete,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again.

 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again.

As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again. They welcome him back with open arms and throw a worldwide party for him featuring delicacies and treats like hamburgers and French fries and pizza and beer, which are all foods that Matt loves.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there.

 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again. They welcome him back with open arms and throw a worldwide party for him featuring delicacies and treats like hamburgers and French fries and pizza and beer, which are all foods that Matt loves.

However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there. 
As Matt's celebrity status continues to grow, the alien is sure he will be promoted as well.
 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again. They welcome him back with open arms and throw a worldwide party for him featuring delicacies and treats like hamburgers and French fries and pizza and beer, which are all foods that Matt loves.

 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own.

text-insert,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. However, humanity is really no match whatsoever for the alien's desire to use Matt to his own advantage. The alien has kidnapped Matt because he thinks that if he brings Matt back to his home planet, he will become a celebrity status. 
As the alien returns to his planet, he finds that his plan has failed.
 The alien realizes that Matt Damon isn't a celebrity, but an unknown person. Matt is really only a celebrity on planet Earth, but on the alien's planet, which is called Zog, he is not. All the other aliens laugh when the alien brings Matt back to planet Zog, because they are sure Matt is nothing. In fact, they think that Matt is just another regular person, nothing more. And moreover, they laugh because of how desperate the alien was to prove his worth to them. 
The alien is upset that he has failed.
 So, he is determined to prove that Matt is more than just a regular person. So, he starts trying to make Matt a celebrity on Zog. That's where the story begins. 

First, the alien takes Matt to a hair salon. He wanted Matt to have a new look so that the other aliens on Zog would know how rare he is. He has Matt's hair cut into an alien style of hair, with sharp points on the sides. He then takes Matt to a clothing store. He makes sure that Matt is dressed in the best clothes, and he dresses Matt in a gold necklace. And finally, he takes Matt to a plastic surgeon. The alien tells the doctor to make Matt look like a ""Zog Space Hero,"" which is a popular superhero on Zog. The plastic surgeon agrees and after the procedure is over, Matt does indeed look like the superhero that the alien admires.  

When the alien introduces Matt's new look to the other aliens, the other aliens are amazed. The aliens had no idea that Matt was anything special, but they are surprised that Matt is like a Zog Space Hero. They end up calling him ""The Zog Space Hero"" and they even start to worship him. They make Matt into a celebrity, and they treat him like he is their god. The alien becomes Matt's personal manager and gains the celebrity status that he was looking for. But the story does not end there.
