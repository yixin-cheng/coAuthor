""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though.

""I was, yes. I'm no longer the President. What is this about?"" asked Obama. 

""JFK needs your help."" said the Russian. 
""What kind of help?"" asked Obama.
 He felt odd saying this considering JFK was supposed to be dead.
""He needs you to be the President again.
"" said the Russian.

""I can't be President again in the US."" said Obama. 

""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though. 
""Welcome to the team Barack."" said JFK.

""I can't be President again in the US."" said Obama. 

""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though.

""I can't be President again in the US."" said Obama. 

""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though. 
""Welcome to the team Barack."" said JFK.

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though.

""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though. 
""Welcome to the team Barack."" said JFK.


Obama then shakes his firm, robotic hand.

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" You call the number and are greeted by a man with a thick Russian accent. He is very secretive about what is to come next. He asks you to meet him at a local coffee shop. You arrive at the coffee shop and are greeted by a man who looks like he's been on the wrong side of a few too many bar fights.

You take a seat beside him and order a coffee. The man looks you up and down. 

""So this is the great President of the Americas."" said the Russian.

""I was, yes. I'm no longer the President. What is this about?"" asked Obama. 

""JFK needs your help."" said the Russian. 
""What kind of help?"" asked Obama.
 He felt odd saying this considering JFK was supposed to be dead.
""He needs you to be the President again.
"" said the Russian.

""I can't be President again in the US."" said Obama. 

""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though. 
""Welcome to the team Barack."" said JFK.


Obama then shakes his firm, robotic hand. 

""So how do I become President? Putin will not step down.""

JFK then leads Obama into a lab at the back of the warehouse. There is a large machine with lots of blades and syringes that is designed for someone to stand in. 

""We will make you look like Putin, then the country is yours"" said JFK.
