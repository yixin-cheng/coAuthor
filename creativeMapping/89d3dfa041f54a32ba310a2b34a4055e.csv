""Oh!"" said the princess, quite alarmed. ""I don't know what to say! There are so many of you."" 
""We are at your service, Your Majesty,"" said the bees, bowing low.
 ""Anything you desire is our pleasure."" 
""Well,"" said the princess, ""I would like some honey for my tea.""


""Right away, Your Majesty."" Suddenly, all of the bees swarmed the princess's tea cup in a frenzy. She screamed and jumped back.

 The bees brought her an umbrella for the sun. She waved her hand at it, uninterested. 
""I don't want that,"" she said.

A short while later, the princess was strolling through the garden without a care in the world. She removed her sun hat and let her hair fall down loose. She smiled as the bees buzzed around her. She smiled in the shade of the large cloud above her head. She looked up at her bees and said ""I'm so glad I have you. I never did care for direct sunlight. Now I can go for walks midday.""

""Oh!"" said the princess, quite alarmed. ""I don't know what to say! There are so many of you."" 
""We are at your service, Your Majesty,"" said the bees, bowing low.
 ""Anything you desire is our pleasure."" 
""Well,"" said the princess, ""I would like some honey for my tea.""


""Right away, Your Majesty."" Suddenly, all of the bees swarmed the princess's tea cup in a frenzy. She screamed and jumped back. 
""What are you doing?"" she cried.
 ""That's my tea! Isn't that dangerous?"" 
""We're sorry, Your Majesty,"" said the bees.

 The bees brought her an umbrella for the sun. She waved her hand at it, uninterested. 
""I don't want that,"" she said.
 ""I have a better idea.""

A short while later, the princess was strolling through the garden without a care in the world. She removed her sun hat and let her hair fall down loose. She smiled as the bees buzzed around her. She smiled in the shade of the large cloud above her head. She looked up at her bees and said ""I'm so glad I have you. I never did care for direct sunlight. Now I can go for walks midday.""
