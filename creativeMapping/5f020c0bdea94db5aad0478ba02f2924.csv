""You're Dirk Haynes,"" she said.
 ""But you remind me of the last guy I dated"" she continued. ""He was a little bit like you, but he was a little bit different.""

""How so?"" Dirk asked.
""""He wasn't such a putz,"" opined the woman.
Dirk was taken aback.
 ""But that was me,"" he said.
""No, you're Dirk Haynes,"" she said.


""Sure I'm Dirk."" said the man. ""But I was also Matt Cuchosz, Steve Arnott, and even Captain Hastings, the last three guys you dated.""
""No,"" she said.
 ""And besides, aren't the last two characters from 'Line Of Duty'?""
""NIs the show on now? I think it is"" said Dirk.


""Do you want to come over and watch it?"" asked the woman.

""Sure'"" he said. ""This could be the start of a beautiful friendship!""
""I'm not sure,"" she said.
 But do you know what?

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the woman and the shapeshifter have date at swanky wine bistro in the trendy part of town. For this ""first date"" the shapeshifter has come as Dirk Haynes, a wealthy man about town.
The woman is late, and when she arrives, she’s in a hurry.
 She seems to barely pay attention to any of Dirk's well-chosen lines. She’s distracted, and she’s late for something.

Finally Dirk can't help but ask: ""Am I keeping you from something?""
""No, but I’m late for something,"" she says.


""What are you late for?"" asks Dirk.
""I’m late for my date with you,"" she says.


This flummoxed Dirk. ""But you are not late, you're here,"" he said.
""Yes, but I'm late for my date with you,"" she said.


Dirk had an idea. ""Just who do you think I am?"" he asked her.
""You're Dirk Haynes,"" she said.
 ""But you remind me of the last guy I dated"" she continued. ""He was a little bit like you, but he was a little bit different.""
