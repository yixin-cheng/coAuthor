One day, Helena meets a man who seems perfect for her, but she can’t stop thinking about her last date. She wonders if she has a problem. ""Is it me?"" She asks herself.  She is unsure about people. Nobody seems right for her. Then, one day, she meets a man who seems perfect for her. But eventually, she finds something wrong with him. She can’t stop wondering if it’s her.

 She feels a weird energy. Over the next months, Ben and Helena do everything together. He is unaware that it is she, not him, who has changed.  He is happy that he has changed for her,
She lets her guard down and feels the first stirrings of a love she never thought possible.
