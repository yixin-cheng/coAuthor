Helena thinks, ""I have been so scared that I’m going to get hurt.
 I am afraid to let myself feel. It’s time to wake up and let someone love me the way I love them. I’ve got to be strong and brave.""  

Helena resolves to give her next date a fair chance.  She will allow herself to love. She meets a handsome man, Ben, at a coffee shop. Her newfound resolve empowers her, and they hit it off. 
 She feels a weird energy. Over the next months, Ben and Helena do everything together. He is unaware that it is she, not him, who has changed.  He is happy 
She lets her guard down and feels the first stirrings of a love she never thought possible.
