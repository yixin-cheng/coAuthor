As it turns out, some of them even prefer bringing him back dead. They're motivated by greed, and not so much the desire to get Matt Damon for themselves, but to make sure no one else can have him.

In the meantime, our alien has taken Matt Damon on a wild ride through the solar system, showing him all the wonders of the stars. The kidnapping wasn't motived by profit or a desire to possess, it turns out that the alien is a huge fan of Matt Damon, and was simply too shy to introduce himself. The two have become fast friends, and Matt Damon has forgotten that he was ever even kidnapped in the first place. They go to Mars, and dine with the Martians, and have a grand old time. They travel to Venus, and Matt Damon and the alien go into the jungle on a hair (and antenna) raising excursion to bag a Venusian tiger. Next they hit up Saturn, and Matt Damon is stunned by the lovely rings, as well as the fact that they've come so close to terraforming them.

The kidnapping wasn't motived by profit or a desire to possess, it turns out that the alien is a huge fan of Matt Damon, and was simply too shy to introduce himself. The two have become fast friends, and Matt Damon has forgotten that he was ever even kidnapped in the first place. They go to Mars, and dine with the Martians, and have a grand old time. They travel to Venus, and Matt Damon and the alien go into the jungle on a hair (and antenna) raising excursion to bag a Venusian tiger. Next they hit up Saturn, and Matt Damon is stunned by the lovely rings, as well as the fact that they've come so close to terraforming them. As it turns out, all of the planets of the solar system are inhabited by intelligent life, and in fact, they're all a lot nicer than Earth.

But even though Matt Damon has forgotten about Earth, Earth has not forgotten about Matt Damon. The mercenary ship is launched, and begins its slow crawl through the solar system to retrieve the wayward actor. They finally catch up with the actor and his new best friend on Pluto, where Matt Damon and the alien are just hanging out by a pool. They try to 'rescue' Matt Damon, and the alien defends him by hurling his body forward at the mercenaries. They open fire, and the alien is blown to pieces. Enraged and crazy with grief, Matt Damon seizes one of the mercenaries' guns and  attacks the killers, who are not expecting this kind of resistance from the  seemingly ineffectual Hollywood star.

As it turns out, some of them even prefer bringing him back dead. They're motivated by greed, and not so much the desire to get Matt Damon for themselves, but to make sure no one else can have him.

In the meantime, our alien has taken Matt Damon on a wild ride through the solar system, showing him all the wonders of the stars. The kidnapping wasn't motived by profit or a desire to possess, it turns out that the alien is a huge fan of Matt Damon, and was simply too shy to introduce himself.

They travel to Venus, and Matt Damon and the alien go into the jungle on a hair (and antenna) raising excursion to bag a Venusian tiger. Next they hit up Saturn, and Matt Damon is stunned by the lovely rings, as well as the fact that they've come so close to terraforming them. As it turns out, all of the planets of the solar system are inhabited by intelligent life, and in fact, they're all a lot nicer than Earth.

But even though Matt Damon has forgotten about Earth, Earth has not forgotten about Matt Damon. The mercenary ship is launched, and begins its slow crawl through the solar system to retrieve the wayward actor. They finally catch up with the actor and his new best friend on Pluto, where Matt Damon and the alien are just hanging out by a pool. They try to 'rescue' Matt Damon, and the alien defends him by hurling his body forward at the mercenaries. They open fire, and the alien is blown to pieces. Enraged and crazy with grief, Matt Damon seizes one of the mercenaries' guns and  attacks the killers, who are not expecting this kind of resistance from the  seemingly ineffectual Hollywood star.

In the meantime, our alien has taken Matt Damon on a wild ride through the solar system, showing him all the wonders of the stars.

The two have become fast friends, and Matt Damon has forgotten that he was ever even kidnapped in the first place. They go to Mars, and dine with the Martians, and have a grand old time. They travel to Venus, and Matt Damon and the alien go into the jungle on a hair (and antenna) raising excursion to bag a Venusian tiger. Next they hit up Saturn, and Matt Damon is stunned by the lovely rings, as well as the fact that they've come so close to terraforming them. As it turns out, all of the planets of the solar system are inhabited by intelligent life, and in fact, they're all a lot nicer than Earth.

They try to 'rescue' Matt Damon, and the alien defends him by hurling his body forward at the mercenaries. They open fire, and the alien is blown to pieces.

Enraged and crazy with grief, Matt Damon seizes one of the mercenaries' guns and  attacks the killers, who are not expecting this kind of resistance from the  seemingly ineffectual Hollywood star.

They ’ve put together an elite team, comprised of the best mercenaries our planet has to offer. These men will stop at nothing to bring Matt Damon home, dead or alive. As it turns out, some of them even prefer bringing him back dead. They're motivated by greed, and not so much the desire to get Matt Damon for themselves, but to make sure no one else can have him.

In the meantime, our alien has taken Matt Damon on a wild ride through the solar system, showing him all the wonders of the stars. The kidnapping wasn't motived by profit or a desire to possess, it turns out that the alien is a huge fan of Matt Damon, and was simply too shy to introduce himself. The two have become fast friends, and Matt Damon has forgotten that he was ever even kidnapped in the first place. They go to Mars, and dine with the Martians, and have a grand old time. They travel to Venus, and Matt Damon and the alien go into the jungle on a hair (and antenna) raising excursion to bag a Venusian tiger. Next they hit up Saturn, and Matt Damon is stunned by the lovely rings, as well as the fact that they've come so close to terraforming them. As it turns out, all of the planets of the solar system are inhabited by intelligent life, and in fact, they're all a lot nicer than Earth.

But even though Matt Damon has forgotten about Earth, Earth has not forgotten about Matt Damon. The mercenary ship is launched, and begins its slow crawl through the solar system to retrieve the wayward actor. They finally catch up with the actor and his new best friend on Pluto, where Matt Damon and the alien are just hanging out by a pool. They try to 'rescue' Matt Damon, and the alien defends him by hurling his body forward at the mercenaries. They open fire, and the alien is blown to pieces. Enraged and crazy with grief, Matt Damon seizes one of the mercenaries' guns and  attacks the killers, who are not expecting this kind of resistance from the  seemingly ineffectual Hollywood star.
