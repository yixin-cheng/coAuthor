Every major country now had a well-developed space program.  This space program allowed these countries to harvest the resources in our solar system.  One of those resources is a resource called helium-3.  Helium-3 is a non-radioactive isotope that allowed countries to utilize nuclear energy without the fear of nuclear waste.   This meant that every person in these countries had access to plentiful energy.  They didn't have to worry about a home without heat or electricity.

The main reason why the other countries advanced so quickly was due to the exchange of information.  After World War III, the countries who didn't isolate focused on the exchange of good and useful technical information.   This allowed them to advance much faster than the United States.

Every major country now had a well-developed space program.  This space program allowed these countries to harvest the resources in our solar system.  One of those resources is a resource called helium-3.  Helium-3 is a non-radioactive isotope that allowed countries to utilize nuclear energy without the fear of nuclear waste.   This meant that every person in these countries had access to plentiful energy.  They didn't have to worry about a home without heat or electricity.
