On the screen I see myself as a doctor who works in remote areas to save lives. One day I am called to a village to treat a patient. The patient is very sick and needs medicine. I have no medicine with me, but I try to make the patient comfortable and wait for him to get well. The next day I went to a different village to find the right medicine for the sick patient. I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey.

On the screen I see myself as a doctor who works in remote areas to save lives. One day I am called to a village to treat a patient. The patient is very sick and needs medicine. I have no medicine with me, but I try to make the patient comfortable and wait for him to get well. The next day I went to a different village to find the right medicine for the sick patient. I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week.

I treated her for a few days, and the woman started feeling better. She paid me for the medicine. As it turns out she was very wealthy and could afford the medicine.

I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health.

On the screen I see myself as a doctor who works in remote areas to save lives. One day I am called to a village to treat a patient. The patient is very sick and needs medicine. I have no medicine with me, but I try to make the patient comfortable and wait for him to get well. The next day I went to a different village to find the right medicine for the sick patient. I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week. I was still thinking about the patient from the previous day. ""What if she also can't afford medicine?"", I wondered. But I decided to treat the woman anyway. I treated her for a few days, and the woman started feeling better. She paid me for the medicine. As it turns out she was very wealthy and could afford the medicine.

On the screen I see myself as a doctor who works in remote areas to save lives. One day I am called to a village to treat a patient. The patient is very sick and needs medicine. I have no medicine with me, but I try to make the patient comfortable and wait for him to get well. The next day I went to a different village to find the right medicine for the sick patient. I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week. I was still thinking about the patient from the previous day. ""What if she also can't afford medicine?"", I wondered. But I decided to treat the woman anyway.

I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week. I was still thinking about the patient from the previous day. ""What if she also can't afford medicine?"", I wondered. But I decided to treat the woman anyway. I treated her for a few days, and the woman started feeling better. She paid me for the medicine. As it turns out she was very wealthy and could afford the medicine. ""I heard what you did,"" she said, referring to paying for the other patient's medicine. And she slipped a diamond into his hand. ""You can keep this as a reward."" And then she left.

On the screen I see myself as a doctor who works in remote areas to save lives. One day I am called to a village to treat a patient. The patient is very sick and needs medicine. I have no medicine with me, but I try to make the patient comfortable and wait for him to get well. The next day I went to a different village to find the right medicine for the sick patient. I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week. I was still thinking about the patient from the previous day. ""What if she also can't afford medicine?"", I wondered. But I decided to treat the woman anyway. I treated her for a few days, and the woman started feeling better. She paid me for the medicine. As it turns out she was very wealthy and could afford the medicine. ""I heard what you did,"" she said, referring to paying for the other patient's medicine. And she slipped a diamond into his hand. ""You can keep this as a reward."" And then she left.
