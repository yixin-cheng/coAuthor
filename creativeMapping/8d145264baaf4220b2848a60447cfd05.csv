The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""That's a really good house, little pig.
  As the fox was very impressed. It was by far better then the brick house he recently ran a bulldozer through. he wolf was like, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house down.""
 Then the piggy and wolf both had a good laugh. So how did you manage to mine all the uranium the wolf asks?. I found an old mine and it was already dug out. I just had to push it here in a cart. Interesting said the fox. How did you manage to shape the uranium into bricks? It was easy said the pig, I used the uranium brick press that was at the local Home Depot. 
The wolf was suspicious at this point. He knew of no uranium brink press at Home Depot. So the wolf ran off to grab his Gyger counter. It was uranium all right and it was slowly cooking the pig inside. This gave the wolf idea. He would just hang out close by until the pig was slow cooked to perfection. The wolf thought this was an ingenious plan, he remebered 9th grade science like it was yesterday and was confident his plan would work. After about 24 hours the smell of pork filled the air.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""That's a really good house, little pig.
  As the fox was very impressed. It was by far better then the brick house he recently ran a bulldozer through. he wolf was like, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house down.""
 Then the piggy and wolf both had a good laugh. So how did you manage to mine all the uranium the wolf asks?. I found an old mine and it was already dug out. I just had to push it here in a cart. Interesting said the fox. How did you manage to shape the uranium into bricks? It was easy said the pig, I used the uranium brick press that was at the local Home Depot. 
The wolf was suspicious at this point. He knew of no uranium brink press at Home Depot. So the wolf ran off to grab his Gyger counter. It was uranium all right and it was slowly cooking the pig inside. This gave the wolf idea. He would just hang out close by until the pig was slow cooked to perfection. The wolf thought this was an ingenious plan, he remebered 9th grade science like it was yesterday and was confident his plan would work. After about 24 hours the smell of pork filled the air.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""That's a really good house, little pig.
  As the fox was very impressed. It was by far better then the brick house he recently ran a bulldozer through. he wolf was like, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house down.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""That's a really good house, little pig.

 Then the piggy and wolf both had a good laugh. So how did you manage to mine all the uranium the wolf asks?. I found an old mine and it was already dug out. I just had to push it here in a cart. Interesting said the fox. How did you manage to shape the uranium into bricks? It was easy said the pig, I used the uranium brick press that was at the local Home Depot. 
The wolf was suspicious at this point. He knew of no uranium brink press at Home Depot. So the wolf ran off to grab his Gyger counter. It was uranium all right and it was slowly cooking the pig inside. This gave the wolf idea. He would just hang out close by until the pig was slow cooked to perfection.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""That's a really good house, little pig.
  As the fox was very impressed. It was by far better then the brick house he recently ran a bulldozer through. he wolf was like, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house down.""
 Then the piggy and wolf both had a good laugh. So how did you manage to mine all the uranium the wolf asks?. I found an old mine and it was already dug out. I just had to push it here in a cart. Interesting said the fox. How did you manage to shape the uranium into bricks? It was easy said the pig, I used the uranium brick press that was at the local Home Depot. 
The wolf was suspicious at this point. He knew of no uranium brink press at Home Depot. So the wolf ran off to grab his Gyger counter. It was uranium all right and it was slowly cooking the pig inside. This gave the wolf idea. He would just hang out close by until the pig was slow cooked to perfection. The wolf thought this was an ingenious plan, he remembered 9th grade science like it was yesterday and was confident his plan would work. After about 24 hours the smell of pork filled the air. The wolf strolled over, very happy with himself, scooped up the roasted pig and took him home to eat. The pig was better then expected. It had a taste unlike anything the wolf had ever tried before.

It was uranium all right and it was slowly cooking the pig inside. This gave the wolf idea. He would just hang out close by until the pig was slow cooked to perfection. The wolf thought this was an ingenious plan, he remembered 9th grade science like it was yesterday and was confident his plan would work. After about 24 hours the smell of pork filled the air. The wolf strolled over, very happy with himself, scooped up the roasted pig and took him home to eat. The pig was better then expected. It had a taste unlike anything the wolf had ever tried before. There was one thing the wolf missed in 9th grade science and that was what is exposed to radioactivity becomes radio active itself.

text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""That's a really good house, little pig.
  As the fox was very impressed. It was by far better then the brick house he recently ran a bulldozer through. he wolf was like, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house down.""
 Then the piggy and wolf both had a good laugh. So how did you manage to mine all the uranium the wolf asks?. I found an old mine and it was already dug out. I just had to push it here in a cart. Interesting said the fox. How did you manage to shape the uranium into bricks? It was easy said the pig, I used the uranium brick press that was at the local Home Depot. 
The wolf was suspicious at this point. He knew of no uranium brink press at Home Depot. So the wolf ran off to grab his Gyger counter. It was uranium all right and it was slowly cooking the pig inside. This gave the wolf idea. He would just hang out close by until the pig was slow cooked to perfection.
