The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

""Surprised?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf. The wolf replied, ""I'm not surprised, but I am hungry."" 

""You've eaten a lot of my kind, Mr. Wolf,"" said the pig. ""I won't be your next meal."" 

The wolf tried to get near the 92nd little pig to eat it but a force field of depleted uranium repelled him. ""Wha... what is this?"" asked the wolf. ""It's depleted uranium, you big bad wolf!"" Said the pig. The wolf tried punching the barrier but to no avail. It was shiny as new and the wolf eventually got tired of punching the barrier.

Then the pig said, ""I'm going to go get some more depleted uranium to make my house even stronger."" The wolf started laughing menacingly and said, ""Oh, I may not be able to eat you, but I can still eat your brother and sister pigs.""

Undeterred, the pig replied, ""We're not afraid of you anymore, wolf!"" We outnumber you! They've also built their own houses made out of depleted uranium!""
