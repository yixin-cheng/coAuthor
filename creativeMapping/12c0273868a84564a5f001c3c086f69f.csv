The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I can't blow that down. That's not fair. Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home. 

The wolf had a match and lit it. He threw the match at the home and nothing happened. The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I can't blow that down. That's not fair. Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

The wolf had a match and lit it. He threw the match at the home and nothing happened. The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I can't blow that down. That's not fair. Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I can't blow that down. That's not fair. Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home. 

The wolf had a match and lit it. He threw the match at the home and nothing happened. The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened. 

The little pig strolled by and walked up to the wolf. He explained that this wasn't typical uranium. It's a special type of uranium that can't be destroyed. The wolf was so angry. He had to go back to the drawing board.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I can't blow that down. That's not fair. Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home. 

The wolf had a match and lit it. He threw the match at the home and nothing happened. The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened. 

The little pig strolled by and walked up to the wolf. He explained that this wasn't typical uranium. It's a special type of uranium that can't be destroyed. The wolf was so angry. He had to go back to the drawing board.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I can't blow that down. That's not fair. Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.

The 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home. 

The wolf had a match and lit it. He threw the match at the home and nothing happened. The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened. 

The little pig strolled by and walked up to the wolf. He explained that this wasn't typical uranium. It's a special type of uranium that can't be destroyed. The wolf was so angry. He had to go back to the drawing board.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.
