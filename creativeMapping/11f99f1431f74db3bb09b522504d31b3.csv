You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard.

He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuba",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean.

You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so.

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Third Gunman T",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Second Gunman Theory No",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so.

You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Second Gunman Theory Nonsense.' it s",user,36,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Second Gunman Theory Nonsense.' it says. You smil",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Second Gunman Theory Nonsense.' it says. You smile grimly, and hope that your new cellmae",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Second Gunman Theory Nonsense.' it says. You smile grimly, and hope that your new cellmate isn't go",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. 
You pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro.
 Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand.

You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.

A few days later in a Havana prison, you read the paper. ""Castro Assassinated by Obama - Second Gunman Theory Nonsense.' it says. You smile grimly, and hope that your new cellmate isn't going to be Jac",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

You pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the ""real job"" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds ""Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.""

So, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.

You have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself ""I know that guy from somewhere..."" but you can't place him.

You shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.

The bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance.
