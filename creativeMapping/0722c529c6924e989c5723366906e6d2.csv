The strike force is comprised of a dozen of the most elite soldiers in the wcountry all with special abilities.
 Hours later, a line of Black Suburban SUVs are facing a slimy exoskeleton, with two eye-stalks protruding, one of its claws holding on to Matt Damon.
The alien is holding a hand-held device, and it speaks in a deep, raspy voice: ""I have the human.
 He's gonna need therapy after this one.""
The lead soldier, a man with a dark complexion and a scar on his face, says, ""We're gonna need a bsocial worker on site""

The alien responds, ""I'm not gonna hurt him.
 I just wanted his autograph.""

"" Dream on, "" says the alien, and bright cosmic rays emanate from his eye-stalks.
The soldiers all fall to the ground, unconscious.
 The alien hands Matt a pen and a movie poster from Argo.
Matt signs, and the alien says, ""Thanks, man.
 The wifey will sure get a kick out of this one.""
The alien then teleports away, leaving Matt alone in the desert.
 Matt staggers toward the awakening soldiers.
""I'm okay,"" he says.
 

""That's great, but you could have asked if we were okay!"" says the lead soldier.
""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" says Matt.
 ""But how much will you get paid for your next picture, you loser?""
The soldiers all look at each other, and then they all start beating Matt with their wnpened hand
