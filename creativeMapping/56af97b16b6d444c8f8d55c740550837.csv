""JFK?"" asked Obama internally. ""This must be some kind of a sick joke."" He murmurs. Obama reluctantly picked up the phone and dialed the number. ""Hello? This is Barack Obama. Who is this? Is this a prank?"" he said annoyingly. The person on the other line said, ""I'm sorry Mr. President, but this is no joke. My name is John F. Kennedy, and I'm calling you from the year 2035.""

""Okay, I'm hanging up."" Obama said as he hang up the old-fashioned wired telephone. Almost immediately a hologram of JFK appears on the phone. ""This is impossible,"" said Obama, shocked.

JFK said, ""I know it's hard to believe, but I'm really here. In 2025 a global attack will be carried out by extraterrestrial forces. We call them the ""Xeno-Sapiens"". I'm calling you right now to prepare for it.""

Still in shock, Obama said, ""You're telling me that in 2025, aliens are going to attack us?"" ""Absolutely,"" JFK replied.

""JFK?"" asked Obama internally. ""This must be some kind of a sick joke."" He murmurs. Obama reluctantly picked up the phone and dialed the number. ""Hello? This is Barack Obama. Who is this? Is this a prank?"" he said annoyingly. The person on the other line said, ""I'm sorry Mr. President, but this is no joke. My name is John F. Kennedy, and I'm calling you from the year 2035.""

""Okay, I'm hanging up."" Obama said as he hang up the old-fashioned wired telephone. Almost immediately a hologram of JFK appears on the phone. ""This is impossible,"" said Obama, shocked.

JFK said, ""I know it's hard to believe, but I'm really here. In 2025 a global attack will be carried out by extraterrestrial forces. We call them the ""Xeno-Sapiens"". I'm calling you right now to prepare for it.""

Still in shock, Obama said, ""You're telling me that in 2025, aliens are going to attack us?"" ""Absolutely,"" JFK replied.

""But why not tell the world?"" asked Obama.
""Because the world will not believe us.
"" replied JFK. ""It is too dangerous. They already have infiltrated us. Remember COVID-19?""

""Yeah?"" said Obama. ""Well, that was a bioweapon developed by a group of humans who were working with the Xeno-Sapiens,"" explained JFK.
