It wasnt actually a name, but  some writing on the cup that was unfinished. I saw a J, and the o was being drawn although i saw no marker or pen. The letter kept appearing and dissapearing over and over, like some sort of magic. It was like it was trying to tell me something. Maybe that my job of being a father is unfinished. You see I am a father, but not a biological father. I married into having four step kids, whom i love each and every one of. I feel that i am a good father, and I know that i do my best each and every day to be one. I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup.

 Suddenly my eyes open, and I am in my bedroom. I knew it, just a dream. I look to my dressor and see a mug. Of course, the #1 dad mug. I grab it and look at the name on it. It wasnt actually a name, but  some writing on the cup that was unfinished. I saw a J, and the o was being drawn although i saw no marker or pen. The letter kept appearing and dissapearing over and over, like some sort of magic. It was like it was trying to tell me something. Maybe that my job of being a father is unfinished. You see I am a father, but not a biological father. I married into having four step kids, whom i love each and every one of. I feel that i am a good father, and I know that i do my best each and every day to be one. I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup. Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me.

 Suddenly my eyes open, and I am in my bedroom. I knew it, just a dream. I look to my dressor and see a mug. Of course, the #1 dad mug. I grab it and look at the name on it. It wasnt actually a name, but  some writing on the cup that was unfinished. I saw a J, and the o was being drawn although i saw no marker or pen. The letter kept appearing and dissapearing over and over, like some sort of magic. It was like it was trying to tell me something. Maybe that my job of being a father is unfinished. You see I am a father, but not a biological father. I married into having four step kids, whom i love each and every one of. I feel that i am a good father, and I know that i do my best each and every day to be one. I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup. Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me. I tried to remember what i was doing last when i fell into this dream like mode. Was I stressed, happy, anxious? Why am i deliberating how good of a dad I am?

 Suddenly my eyes open, and I am in my bedroom. I knew it, just a dream. I look to my dressor and see a mug. Of course, the #1 dad mug. I grab it and look at the name on it. It wasnt actually a name, but  some writing on the cup that was unfinished. I saw a J, and the o was being drawn although i saw no marker or pen. The letter kept appearing and dissapearing over and over, like some sort of magic. It was like it was trying to tell me something. Maybe that my job of being a father is unfinished. You see I am a father, but not a biological father. I married into having four step kids, whom i love each and every one of. I feel that i am a good father, and I know that i do my best each and every day to be one. I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup. Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me.

. All of a sudden all of the names are erased. I assumed that this meant the rankings were reset, but why? Is this giving every dad another chance to be great? Or maybe i am just dreaming so reality is setting back in. I dont know what to think.  reach out and touch one of the mugs.
 Suddenly my eyes open, and I am in my bedroom. I knew it, just a dream. I look to my dressor and see a mug. Of course, the #1 dad mug. I grab it and look at the name on it. It wasnt actually a name, but  some writing on the cup that was unfinished. I saw a J, and the o was being drawn although i saw no marker or pen. The letter kept appearing and dissapearing over and over, like some sort of magic. It was like it was trying to tell me something. Maybe that my job of being a father is unfinished. You see I am a father, but not a biological father. I married into having four step kids, whom i love each and every one of. I feel that i am a good father, and I know that i do my best each and every day to be one. I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup. Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me. I tried to remember what i was doing last when i fell into this dream like mode. Was I stressed, happy, anxious? Why am i deliberating how good of a dad I am? Just like that i woke up again, but this time really woke up. I asked my buddy where i was. He told me that i had taken some shrooms and was most likely hallucinating or in a trans....
