The issue is, the scientists just got this experiment wrong. There wasn't supposed to be any side effects. And when a cure is finally created, it's not enough. All the cure can do is prevent one side effect which is headaches. The other side effects are much worse.
The damage from the other side effects is permanent, in fact irreversible.
 Those side effects are amnesia and muscle dystrophy. Those are things that no human being would want to go through. The worst part is that all of these human beings who thought they were going to be immortal now know their fate. There is no preventing these side effects. 

The mental anguish and stress those patients are going through is excruciating. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute. Imagine knowing that at a specific point in your life, you are 100% going to have amnesia and therefore forget everything you once remembered. That is a scary thought.

 Those side effects are amnesia and muscle dystrophy. Those are things that no human being would want to go through. The worst part is that all of these human beings who thought they were going to be immortal now know their fate. There is no preventing these side effects. 

The mental anguish and stress those patients are going through is excruciating. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute. Imagine knowing that at a specific point in your life, you are 100% going to have amnesia and therefore forget everything you once remembered. That is a scary thought.
