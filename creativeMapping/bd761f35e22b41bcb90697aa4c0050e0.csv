Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

A cure is quickly synthesized, but the damage has already been done. If only the side effects had been discovered earlier...but sadly not enough research was done. Immortality is something that most humans want. And even having a chance at immortality is something humans will take giant risks for.

The issue is, the scientists just got this experiment wrong. There wasn't supposed to be any side effects. And when a cure is finally created, it's not enough. All the cure can do is prevent one side effect which is headaches. The other side effects are much worse.
The damage from the other side effects is permanent, in fact irreversible.
 Those side effects are amnesia and muscle dystrophy. Those are things that no human being would want to go through. The worst part is that all of these human beings who thought they were going to be immortal now know their fate. There is no preventing these side effects. 

The mental anguish and stress those patients are going through is excruciating. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute. Imagine knowing that at a specific point in your life, you are 100% going to have amnesia and therefore forget everything you once remembered. That is a scary thought.

A cure is quickly synthesized, but the damage has already been done. If only the side effects had been discovered earlier...but sadly not enough research was done. Immortality is something that most humans want. And even having a chance at immortality is something humans will take giant risks for.

The issue is, the scientists just got this experiment wrong. There wasn't supposed to be any side effects. And when a cure is finally created, it's not enough. All the cure can do is prevent one side effect which is headaches. The other side effects are much worse.
The damage from the other side effects is permanent, in fact irreversible.
 Those side effects are amnesia and muscle dystrophy. Those are things that no human being would want to go through. The worst part is that all of these human beings who thought they were going to be immortal now know their fate. There is no preventing these side effects. 

The mental anguish and stress those patients are going through is excruciating. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute. Imagine knowing that at a specific point in your life, you are 100% going to have amnesia and therefore forget everything you once remembered. That is a scary thought.

A cure is quickly synthesized, but the damage has already been done. If only the side effects had been discovered earlier...but sadly not enough research was done. Immortality is something that most humans want. And even having a chance at immortality is something humans will take giant risks for.

The issue is, the scientists just got this experiment wrong. There wasn't supposed to be any side effects. And when a cure is finally created, it's not enough. All the cure can do is prevent one side effect which is headaches. The other side effects are much worse.
The damage from the other side effects is permanent, in fact irreversible.
 Those side effects are amnesia and muscle dystrophy. Those are things that no human being would want to go through. The worst part is that all of these human beings who thought they were going to be immortal now know their fate. There is no preventing these side effects. 

The mental anguish and stress those patients are going through is excruciating. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute. Imagine knowing that at a specific point in your life, you are 100% going to have amnesia and therefore forget everything you once remembered. That is a scary thought. 

I feel like you'd fear each day would be the day where your memory finally goes. Forgetting something small could cause anxiety and panic. It could make you think that the permanent amnesia has finally arrived. I feel for those souls. All of us humans want to live forever.
