The astronauts land on the Moon and find a small colony of people who have been living there for 50 years.
 These intelligent people could see what was going to happen to the remaining countries after the third world war, and fled to space as soon as they were able to obtain a space craft. They have been living peacefully there for fifty years, and aren't happy to see anyone from Earth searching them out. They are a very peaceful people, and don't want to be bothered by anyone. The moon citizens remember how violent and unethical the people from the US had been in the past, and they want to part of them in their peaceful colony. The astronauts are sent back to Earth with the message that the Moon citizens want to be left alone.

The US government is disgusted to find out that these people don't want to return to Earth. And further irritated that they don't want to welcome Americans to their homestead. The US government decides that the Moon citizens must be destroyed, and sends a team of astronauts to the Moon to destroy the colony. No one can be allowed to live who disagrees with the commands of the US government. As the other countries were dying out over the past 50 years around the globe, the United States was becoming a dictatorship. The free will of the people was reduced to nothing, and the government told everyone what to do in almost all aspects of their lives.

The astronauts land on the Moon and find a small colony of people who have been living there for 50 years.
 These intelligent people could see what was going to happen to the remaining countries after the third world war, and fled to space as soon as they were able to obtain a space craft. They have been living peacefully there for fifty years, and aren't happy to see anyone from Earth searching them out. They are a very peaceful people, and don't want to be bothered by anyone. The moon citizens remember how violent and unethical the people from the US had been in the past, and they want to part of them in their peaceful colony. The astronauts are sent back to Earth with the message that the Moon citizens want to be left alone.

The US government is disgusted to find out that these people don't want to return to Earth. And further irritated that they don't want to welcome Americans to their homestead.

No one can be allowed to live who disagrees with the commands of the US government.

The astronauts land on the Moon and find a small colony of people who have been living there for 50 years.
 These intelligent people could see what was going to happen to the remaining countries after the third world war, and fled to space as soon as they were able to obtain a space craft. They have been living peacefully there for fifty years, and aren't happy to see anyone from Earth searching them out. They are a very peaceful people, and don't want to be bothered by anyone. The moon citizens remember how violent and unethical the people from the US had been in the past, and they want to part of them in their peaceful colony. The astronauts are sent back to Earth with the message that the Moon citizens want to be left alone.

The US government is disgusted to find out that these people don't want to return to Earth. And further irritated that they don't want to welcome Americans to their homestead.
