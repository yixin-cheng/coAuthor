For example, one man was about to crash his car into a tree but was able to slow time down just as a result of his panic This allowed him to open the door, roll out of the car, and land softly in some bushes while his car exploded into a million pieces, none of which was a part of himself.

The fourth sign of the new power is the ability to shoot fireballs from one's hands.
 The fire travels about 4 feet and if one hits you you don't even know it, so no one is too excited about this one.

1346,text-insert,"Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 

The first sign of the new power is the ability to slow time down for about 6 seconds. This can be useful in many situations. For example, one man was about to crash his car into a tree but was able to slow time down just as a result of his panic This allowed him to open the door, roll out of the car, and land softly in some bushes while his car exploded into a million pieces, none of which was a part of himself. One unfortunate thing: his passenger was not so lucky.
TBut te second sign of the new power is the ability to heal wounds.
 So the man was able to find his somewhat worse-for-wear passenger and by virtue of waving his hands back and firth a few times, restore life. As an added bonus, the passenger was better looking than ever before.
The third sign of the new power is the ability to fly.
 Most people can rise 6 or 7 feet in the air and travel about 200 yards at a speed of about 3 miles an hour. Not that impressive, perhaps, but the consensus is that as the aliens kill more people, mana would be les dilutes and people may be able to fly higher and faster as a result.
The fourth sign of the new power is the ability to shoot fireballs from one's hands.
