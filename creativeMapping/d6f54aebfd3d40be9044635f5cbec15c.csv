You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down.

 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down.

You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace.

In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter.

You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months.

You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are.

She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months.

You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler.

You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her.

Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed.

She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice.

You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich.

You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want.

In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed.

You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler.

You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage.

In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her.

After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace.

On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want.

You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace.

In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are.

But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter.

You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover.

But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt.

In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are.

YIn this next life, yu are a yyoung white blonde woman named Soeurette who is on the brink of her wedding to a man named Matt. Matt is a banker at JPMorgan Chase, and he is very rich. You are an admission associate at a school in New York called St. Hilda's. You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler. You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover.

You were married to Tyler for a few years, and you had a daughter named Harper with him, who you got pregnant with while the two of you were still in college together at St. Lawrence University. You and Tyler were both very young when you got married, and you were both very unhappy in your marriage. Now you can't stand the thought of Tyler and as much as you love your daughter Harper, it pains you to think that your youthful mistakes have made Tyler her father rather than Matt. In fact, you see Harper as a permanent reminder of your mistakes and your past. Part of you feels that Matt sees her that way too, since he has never really bonded with her. But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover. You feel sympathetic toward her, but you also don't since she's not a very likeable character. When she passes and becomes reincarnated as a white man named Jake, you become much more invested in your future self because Jake is a much nicer person than Soeurette was.

But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover. You feel sympathetic toward her, but you also don't since she's not a very likeable character.

 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover. You feel sympathetic toward her, but you also don't since she's not a very likeable character.

It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed.

She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed.

After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter. Less than a year into the marriage, Matt will begin an affair with a woman named Sarah, who is a fellow banker at JPMorgan Chase. Sarah will be a much better fit for Matt than you are. She will be more stable, more mature, and more in line with Matt's vision of the future. You will find out about the affair after Matt and Sarah have been seeing each other for a few months. You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed. The moral of your life is that you should never marry for money, because you will always end up getting hurt, and plus it will bite you in the butt. 

You and your other reincarnations watch breathlessly as Soeurette makes mistake after mistake in her love life, never to recover. You feel sympathetic toward her, but you also don't since she's not a very likeable character. When she passes and becomes reincarnated as a white man named Jake, you become much more invested in your future self because Jake is a much nicer person than Soeurette was. The rest of your life as Jake passes uneventfully, which you are grateful for.",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
