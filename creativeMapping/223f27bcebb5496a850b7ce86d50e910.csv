text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

text-delete,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenchi

When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?""

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be

In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could

Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are abou

When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?""

""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation,

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.

When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You.""

And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up.

Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly. Clive bursts out laughti

He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly. Clive bursts out laughing and hol

In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly.

He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up.

Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound.

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend.""

Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly.

text-delete,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, the shapeshifter sees an advertisement for a seminar on how to be a better boyfriend. He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly.

He thinks it is just the thing he needs to improve himself and make the woman really fall for him, so he signs up. When Clive, the shapeshifter, gets to the seminar, he start to wonder if this is really a good idea. The first sign he sees when he walk in says ""Be the real You."" ""Really difficult,"" thought Clive. ""Especially when my whole existence involves being someone else.""

Frustrated, Clive starts to leave, when he notices a seminar going on in the next auditorium, with a similar theme. ""How to be a better girlfriend."" And who does he see walking in, but Liz, the woman he has been in love with for ages. ""This is an interesting situation,"" thought Clive. Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.

The lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.

Clive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, ""Can I help you?"" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, ""I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself."" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, ""I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter."" She looks at him expectantly. Clive bursts out laughing and hollers ""SO AM I!"" Thrilled that they have found someone similar to themselves, they lock hands and walk off together. Maybe the class was a good ide
