It seemed like an innocuous change for some, especially the dads who learned how they rank up against the other dads of the world. 
But for many, it was a bitter pill to swallow.
 Especially those that found themselves in the top 100, those that were seemingly the best of the best when it came to being a father. It was for these men that the mug changed them in a way they didn't expect. Some of them, gained an inflated ego, taking the time to gloat to the other dads whose rank was beneath them. Others were filled with jealosy and rage, unable to come to terms the fact that they weren't truly number one in the world at being a father, feeling they would be and second-rate at best.

The news blared up to highlight the occurrence, those in the top 100s found themselves much lower ranks, reflecting their behavior in the past couple of days. Others were elated to being ranked higher than before, but their behavior never got as sour and awful as the dads that were initially seemingly ranked as the best. They were calmer, less volatile in their actions, and more mindful of what they did. However, none of the newly highly ranked dads reached the #1 position, suggesting that the previous dad that had that rank was still considered to be #1. So, the world turned its attention to finding out the best dad in the world.
