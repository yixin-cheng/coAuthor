Caleb and his son were drinking coffee and milk when his ""#1 Dad"" mug changed to show his actual dad ranking. It showed that his rank was pitiful. It was so pitiful, in fact, that he was rated in the bottom billion of dads. His son asked him if that was accurate.

""No, of course not!"" Caleb said with a shaky voice. He did his best not to spit his coffee out after seeing the trail of zeros following a six. He wished that his son did not notice. ""I'm just going to set that on a different shelf."" He choked.

""Dad, don't move it!"" His son grabbed at it. Caleb was terrified that his son would see his real ranking and feel that his dad was a failure. 
""Listen, son, I may not be a great dad.
 But, I'm not the worst."" He said. His son looked at the mug. Suddenly a face appeared on the mug. That's when Caleb remembered that he got this mug as a gift from his wife. She was an avid thrift store shopper. This wasn't his mug at all, it was someone else's!

""Daddy, that's not your face! Who is that?"" His son asked.
