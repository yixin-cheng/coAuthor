So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but his lungs got cancer from all the uranium.
 The wolf was sent to stay in the hospital, and no one came to visit him because he was so scary. He thought he would die alone, but the 92nd little pig visited him and was like, ""dude."" The wolf never thought he would get a visit from someone he once tried to eat. 
And the wolf said, ""I'm sorry I tried to eat you.""
 The pig shrugged. ""Don't sweat it. Besides, I've lived in my house long enough that you'd get sick if you ate me. Ain't worth it."" 
So they hung out, and the wolf got better.
 Finally the day came when wolf was ready to go home. He said, ""Thank you for taking care of me."" The pig smiled. ""No problem dude."" 
And then the wolf said, ""Tonight there's going to be a party at my house.
 The pig's ears perked up. ""Really?"" 
""Yeah, and I want you to come.
"" The pig thought about it for a moment. ""I might."" said the pig. ""Maybe I'll see you there."" The pig was excited, so he ran back to his house and got ready for the party. A little while after the party started, there was a knock on the door.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but his lungs got cancer from all the uranium.
 The wolf was sent to stay in the hospital, and no one came to visit him because he was so scary. He thought he would die alone, but the 92nd little pig visited him and was like, ""dude."" The wolf never thought he would get a visit from someone he once tried to eat. 
And the wolf said, ""I'm sorry I tried to eat you.""
 The pig shrugged. ""Don't sweat it. Besides, I've lived in my house long enough that you'd get sick if you ate me. Ain't worth it."" 
So they hung out, and the wolf got better.
 Finally the day came when wolf was ready to go home. He said, ""Thank you for taking care of me."" The pig smiled. ""No problem dude."" 
And then the wolf said, ""Tonight there's going to be a party at my house.
 The pig's ears perked up. ""Really?"" 
""Yeah, and I want you to come.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but his lungs got cancer from all the uranium.
 The wolf was sent to stay in the hospital, and no one came to visit him because he was so scary. He thought he would die alone, but the 92nd little pig visited him and was like, ""dude."" The wolf never thought he would get a visit from someone he once tried to eat. 
And the wolf said, ""I'm sorry I tried to eat you.""
 The pig shrugged. ""Don't sweat it. Besides, I've lived in my house long enough that you'd get sick if you ate me. Ain't worth it."" 
So they hung out, and the wolf got better.
 Finally the day came when wolf was ready to go home. He said, ""Thank you for taking care of me."" The pig smiled. ""No problem dude."" 
And then the wolf said, ""Tonight there's going to be a party at my house.
 The pig's ears perked up. ""Really?"" 
""Yeah, and I want you to come.
"" The pig thought about it for a moment. ""I might."" said the pig. ""Maybe I'll see you there."" The pig was excited, so he ran back to his house and got ready for the party. A little while after the party started, there was a knock on the door. 
""Who is it?""
 There wasn't an answer. The wolf opened the door, and found the pig standing on the porch in an iron lung. ""Hey dude."" said the pig. The wolf stood there in shock. ""Why are you wearing that?""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but his lungs got cancer from all the uranium.
 The wolf was sent to stay in the hospital, and no one came to visit him because he was so scary. He thought he would die alone, but the 92nd little pig visited him and was like, ""dude."" The wolf never thought he would get a visit from someone he once tried to eat. 
And the wolf said, ""I'm sorry I tried to eat you.""
 The pig shrugged. ""Don't sweat it. Besides, I've lived in my house long enough that you'd get sick if you ate me. Ain't worth it."" 
So they hung out, and the wolf got better.
 Finally the day came when wolf was ready to go home. He said, ""Thank you for taking care of me."" The pig smiled. ""No problem dude."" 
And then the wolf said, ""Tonight there's going to be a party at my house.
 The pig's ears perked up. ""Really?"" 
""Yeah, and I want you to come.
"" The pig thought about it for a moment. ""I might."" said the pig. ""Maybe I'll see you there."" The pig was excited, so he ran back to his house and got ready for the party. A little while after the party started, there was a knock on the door. 
""Who is it?""
 There wasn't an answer. The wolf opened the door, and found the pig standing on the porch in an iron lung. ""Hey dude."" said the pig. The wolf stood there in shock. ""Why are you wearing that?"" 

""Because I live in a uranium house and I don't want to get your friends sick."" The wolf was touched. ""Well, you look great!"" 
""Thanks.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but his lungs got cancer from all the uranium.
 The wolf was sent to stay in the hospital, and no one came to visit him because he was so scary. He thought he would die alone, but the 92nd little pig visited him and was like, ""dude."" The wolf never thought he would get a visit from someone he once tried to eat. 
And the wolf said, ""I'm sorry I tried to eat you.""
 The pig shrugged. ""Don't sweat it. Besides, I've lived in my house long enough that you'd get sick if you ate me. Ain't worth it.""

""Who is it?""
 There wasn't an answer. The wolf opened the door, and found the pig standing on the porch in an iron lung. ""Hey dude."" said the pig. The wolf stood there in shock. ""Why are you wearing that?""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The wolf came and huffed and puffed, but his lungs got cancer from all the uranium.
 The wolf was sent to stay in the hospital, and no one came to visit him because he was so scary. He thought he would die alone, but the 92nd little pig visited him and was like, ""dude."" The wolf never thought he would get a visit from someone he once tried to eat. 
And the wolf said, ""I'm sorry I tried to eat you.""
 The pig shrugged. ""Don't sweat it. Besides, I've lived in my house long enough that you'd get sick if you ate me. Ain't worth it."" 
So they hung out, and the wolf got better.
 Finally the day came when wolf was ready to go home. He said, ""Thank you for taking care of me."" The pig smiled. ""No problem dude."" 
And then the wolf said, ""Tonight there's going to be a party at my house.
 The pig's ears perked up. ""Really?"" 
""Yeah, and I want you to come.
"" The pig thought about it for a moment. ""I might."" said the pig. ""Maybe I'll see you there."" The pig was excited, so he ran back to his house and got ready for the party. A little while after the party started, there was a knock on the door. 
""Who is it?""
 There wasn't an answer. The wolf opened the door, and found the pig standing on the porch in an iron lung. ""Hey dude."" said the pig. The wolf stood there in shock. ""Why are you wearing that?"" 

""Because I live in a uranium house and I don't want to get your friends sick."" The wolf was touched. ""Well, you look great!"" 
""Thanks.
