The entire time the U.S. was in isolation it focused all of it's resources on alternate forms of power and developed a form of micro fusion that generates no radioactive byproducts and has made themselves energy independent. Now they do not have to worry about oild deals and gas pipelines with anyone and focused all of their attention on weapons of protection. They did not develop weapons of destruction, they did not develop weapons to use against their neighbors.  They knew that the others would come for them again in time, they just did not think that it would be immediately after coming out of isolation.
In a single day, they have been attacked from all sides by enemies they knew nothing about.
 However the attacks were not successful due to the defenses the U.S. built up over the last fifty years. It seems no one learned from the last war. After considering the options at hand the President and the Council for World Reintegration as it was called, came to a dark decision. The U.S. has decided to use what was built solely for defense against it's attackers and put an end to this madness before it gets any worse. They had built a defense system that was nearly unpassable and had one major flaw. It was connected to the Earth's core and if it were turned off, it would melt down and destroy the planet. The President and the council was tired of constant War and conflict, it seemed all that the human race was good at, and instead of perpetual warfare, they decided it was best to turn off the defense system and let their enemies have one last day of glory before everything came to an end. 

They negotiated a ""truce"" in which the new global consortium would be able to set up operations in the United States after they turned the defenses off. The leaders of the world consortium all showed up to the ceremony that would transfer the U.S. into the consortiums power. The President gave the order to turn off the defenses and as the Leaders landed their aircraft, the ground shook and cracked open. A huge chasm opened up and swallowed the U.S. President along with the other leaders and their aircraft as it fell into the center of the Earth. Lava spewed out of cracks and water boiled.

The entire time the U.S. was in isolation it focused all of it's resources on alternate forms of power and developed a form of micro fusion that generates no radioactive byproducts and has made themselves energy independent.

They did not develop weapons of destruction, they did not develop weapons to use against their neighbors.

The President and the council was tired of constant War and conflict, it seemed all that the human race was good at, and instead of perpetual warfare, they decided it was best to turn off the defense system and let their enemies have one last day of glory before everything came to an end. 

They negotiated a ""truce"" in which the new global consortium would be able to set up operations in the United States after they turned the defenses off. The leaders of the world consortium all showed up to the ceremony that would transfer the U.S. into the consortiums power. The President gave the order to turn off the defenses and as the Leaders landed their aircraft, the ground shook and cracked open.

Now they do not have to worry about oild deals and gas pipelines with anyone and focused all of their attention on weapons of protection. They did not develop weapons of destruction, they did not develop weapons to use against their neighbors.  They knew that the others would come for them again in time, they just did not think that it would be immediately after coming out of isolation.
In a single day, they have been attacked from all sides by enemies they knew nothing about.
 However the attacks were not successful due to the defenses the U.S. built up over the last fifty years. It seems no one learned from the last war. After considering the options at hand the President and the Council for World Reintegration as it was called, came to a dark decision. The U.S. has decided to use what was built solely for defense against it's attackers and put an end to this madness before it gets any worse. They had built a defense system that was nearly unpassable and had one major flaw. It was connected to the Earth's core and if it were turned off, it would melt down and destroy the planet. The President and the council was tired of constant War and conflict, it seemed all that the human race was good at, and instead of perpetual warfare, they decided it was best to turn off the defense system and let their enemies have one last day of glory before everything came to an end. 

They negotiated a ""truce"" in which the new global consortium would be able to set up operations in the United States after they turned the defenses off. The leaders of the world consortium all showed up to the ceremony that would transfer the U.S. into the consortiums power. The President gave the order to turn off the defenses and as the Leaders landed their aircraft, the ground shook and cracked open. A huge chasm opened up and swallowed the U.S. President along with the other leaders and their aircraft as it fell into the center of the Earth. Lava spewed out of cracks and water boiled. People ran screaming as they did not know what was happening. The members of the council sat and watched in shame as they brought themselves and t experiment known as he human race to an end.

To make matters worse, the world has since been plunged into a super-powered arms race, and to maintain peace and stability,  and now they see us as a threat. 

hey are right to be afraid.

The entire time the U.S. was in isolation it focused all of it's resources on alternate forms of power and developed a form of micro fusion that generates no radioactive byproducts and has made themselves energy independent. Now they do not have to worry about oild deals and gas pipelines with anyone and focused all of their attention on weapons of protection.
