Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".

There weren't any visible people, only humans have useable opposable thumbs these days..soooo....?

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.  Sure enough, I heard a rustling, the cows looked up and then, miracle of miracles, milk began to fill the pail that had also miraculously appeared seemingly floating.  Soon a sound was heard, the sound of squirts of milk hitting the pail, though no visible person or being was present.  After while, the udder's emptied, cows fed, they simply wandered off, but the pail floated away, simply floated, as if in the air on a breeze.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either. Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either. Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now.

Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now.

She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now.

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.  Sure enough, I heard a rustling, the cows looked up and then, miracle of miracles, milk began to fill the pail that had also miraculously appeared seemingly floating.  Soon a sound was heard, the sound of squirts of milk hitting the pail, though no visible person or being was present.  After while, the udder's emptied, cows fed, they simply wandered off, but the pail floated away, simply floated, as if in the air on a breeze.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either. Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either. Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.  Sure enough, I heard a rustling, the cows looked up and then, miracle of miracles, milk began to fill the pail that had also miraculously appeared seemingly floating.  Soon a sound was heard, the sound of squirts of milk hitting the pail, though no visible person or being was present.  After while, the udder's emptied, cows fed, they simply wandered off, but the pail floated away, simply floated, as if in the air on a breeze.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either. Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.

After while, the udder's emptied, cows fed, they simply wandered off, but the pail floated away, simply floated, as if in the air on a breeze.

She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

After while, the udder's emptied, cows fed, they simply wandered off, but the pail floated away, simply floated, as if in the air on a breeze.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either. Only heard.    My heart soared. I had decided I would be the end of everything. I asked Mary how this happened. She claimed that she didn't REALLY know but that the aliens must have released a long latent, ""flight"" sense or ability, the ability, held by few, but some, mostly unknown, now made apparent. Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there. Though there are many MOST of the humans didn't have the mana and had been slaughtered by aliens. We agreed, the two of us, to form an alliance, allowing her to milk the cows, if she shared her large vegetable patch she had begun to farm over the next ridge, where she settled.

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.

Some people had the ability to hide when frightened enough. Mostly people never were scared enough to release this ""Mana, or hidden quality, was invisibilty"".  So... now people simply, unknowingly reverted to remaining unseen. This made sense because the aliens were still out there, and might be watching. Invisibility is a survival instinct necessary now. 

   I asked Mary if she had seen any others like us missing, or only me.  She said, oh no, there are many others, you simply don't see them but they are there.

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.  Sure enough, I heard a rustling, the cows looked up and then, miracle of miracles, milk began to fill the pail that had also miraculously appeared seemingly floating.  Soon a sound was heard, the sound of squirts of milk hitting the pail, though no visible person or being was present.  After while, the udder's emptied, cows fed, they simply wandered off, but the pail floated away, simply floated, as if in the air on a breeze.

I followed it, quietly. Then I said, HEY, HEY YOU! The pail stopped and I heard a woman's voice say, HEY. Who are you? I said John, this is my farm, what are you doing, and why can't I see you? The woman said, I'm Mary, and I don't know, but no one, is visible, even you aren't visible to me. I stood Gobsmacked.  Wow, so I was NOT the last person on earth, and I couldn't be seen either.
