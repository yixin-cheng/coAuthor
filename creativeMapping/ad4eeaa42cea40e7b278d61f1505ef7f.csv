All your life, you've been told that you're allergic to bees. This lie was perpetrated by your mother, who is really your stepmother.""

""Let me explain."" You wait. ""You have always been in the royal line."" it explains. ""One of your ancestors was a queen, and she had a child with a mortal man. All your life, you've been told that you're allergic to bees. This lie was perpetrated by your mother, who is really your stepmother.""

You gasp. ""She is from a rival hive."" continues the bee. ""She intends to usurp your throne."" You think about this, and the fact that you've never been all that close to your 'mom', and she looks nothing like you, and wonder about your father. ""What happened to my dad?"" you ask the bee.

The second bee flies closer to you. You flinch, but as you look at it, it conveys an unmistakable impression of patience and wisdom. ""You're confused."" it says in a kindly voice. ""Let me explain."" You wait. ""You have always been in the royal line."" it explains. ""One of your ancestors was a queen, and she had a child with a mortal man. All your life, you've been told that you're allergic to bees. This lie was perpetrated by your mother, who is really your stepmother.""

You gasp. ""She is from a rival hive."" continues the bee. ""She intends to usurp your throne."" You think about this, and the fact that you've never been all that close to your 'mom', and she looks nothing like you, and wonder about your father. ""What happened to my dad?"" you ask the bee. ""Your father was murdered,"" it says, ""and your stepmother had a hand in that.""

""Why have you just told me about all this now?"" you ask. ""I was prevented from doing so before,"" it replies. ""The hive has finally mastered a technique to evade your stepmother's defenses. I assure you, Your Majesty, that this is the first chance we've had to communicate.""

""Well, what should I do now?"" you ask the bee. ""Assume the leadership of your hive."" it replies. ""But first, avenge yourself on your oppressor.""

""Let me explain."" You wait. ""You have always been in the royal line."" it explains. ""One of your ancestors was a queen, and she had a child with a mortal man. All your life, you've been told that you're allergic to bees. This lie was perpetrated by your mother, who is really your stepmother.""

You gasp. ""She is from a rival hive."" continues the bee. ""She intends to usurp your throne."" You think about this, and the fact that you've never been all that close to your 'mom', and she looks nothing like you, and wonder about your father. ""What happened to my dad?"" you ask the bee. ""Your father was murdered,"" it says, ""and your stepmother had a hand in that.""

""Why have you just told me about all this now?"" you ask. ""I was prevented from doing so before,"" it replies. ""The hive has finally mastered a technique to evade your stepmother's defenses. I assure you, Your Majesty, that this is the first chance we've had to communicate.""

""Well, what should I do now?"" you ask the bee. ""Assume the leadership of your hive."" it replies. ""But first, avenge yourself on your oppressor.""

You nod grimly. You head towards your stepmother's room, your new army buzzing around you. Vengeance will be sweet, sweet as honey.",api,47,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
