text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

Trigger warning: Violence,  AI portrayal of mental illness

I jump, startled. ""It's a bee, get it off me!"" I scream, as I run to the servants on the deck.  I knock over the small woman who was standing behind me.  I didn't even notice her before. ""Stand still"", the maid says in her tiny voice, as she grab a towel. ""We'll just get it off you, and then you can go back to your party."" 
""No, no, no, I can't be near it!"" I scream.
 The maid flicks the bee with the towel, and it flies off. ""Oh, thank you, thank you, I can't believe you got it off me."" I say, as I run back to the party. 
""That was weird"", I hear the maid say.
 ""I've never seen someone react like that to a bee before.""
I'm not surprised"", the other maid says.
 ""She's always been a bit of a weirdo."" She leans conspiratorially close. ""She is on a new medication, and has been hearing voices lately"" I heard that too"", the first maid says.


I leap to my feet. There is no way I will let servants talk to me like that! I run back to the deck, and grab the first maid by the hair. ""How dare you talk about me like that!"" I scream, as I pull her to the ground. ""I am the queen, and you will show me respect!"" 
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty"", the maid says, as she tries to get up.
 I kick her in the stomach, and she falls back to the ground. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"" she screams. 
""I'm not done with you yet"", I say, as I grab her by the neck.
 ""You will never disrespect me again, or I will have you executed."" I let go of her, and she crawls away. ""Now, I'm going back to my party."" 

I walk back to the party, and the guests are all staring at me. ""What are you looking at?"" I say. ""I was just teaching a servant a lesson."" 
""I think you should go back to your room"", my husband says. ""You've been acting really strange lately."" 
""I'm fine, I'm fine"", I say. ""I'm just going to go get a drink.""
