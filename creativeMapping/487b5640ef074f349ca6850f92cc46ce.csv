Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug. Although they are elderly, medical science has advanced and many are in fairly manageable health. They are also very motivated to protect the younger generation from the tentacles. Many of the treated generation reside in groups so that it is easier for the Lost Generation to help care for them.

The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug. Although they are elderly, medical science has advanced and many are in fairly manageable health. They are also very motivated to protect the younger generation from the tentacles.

The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug.

 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug. Although they are elderly, medical science has advanced and many are in fairly manageable health. They are also very motivated to protect the younger generation from the tentacles. Many of the treated generation reside in groups so that it is easier for the Lost Generation to help care for them. 
The Lost Generation has a number of organizations that help them to protect the treated generation.
 However, it is only a matter of time until most members of the older generation, who aged naturally, will be more limited in their ability to assist and will require care themselves.

 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug. Although they are elderly, medical science has advanced and many are in fairly manageable health. They are also very motivated to protect the younger generation from the tentacles. Many of the treated generation reside in groups so that it is easier for the Lost Generation to help care for them. 
The Lost Generation has a number of organizations that help them to protect the treated generation.
 However, it is only a matter of time until most members of the older generation, who aged naturally, will be more limited in their ability to assist and will require care themselves. Meanwhile, doctors and scientists are working on a cure. For the younger doctors and scient, this work often takes place in oceanside centers to reduce distractions from their symbiotic occupants. Hopefully, when the cure is found, it will not have... side effects. ",user,19,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
