Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug.

The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug.

The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug. Although they are elderly, medical science has advanced and many are in fairly manageable health. They are also very motivated to protect the younger generation from the tentacles.
