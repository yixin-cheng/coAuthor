The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge",user,32,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge from their houses.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge from their houses.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge from their houses.

 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge from their houses.  When they saw what happened, they realized the 92nd little pig had solved the problem of the wolf that liked to blow down houses.  They applauded as the 92nd little pig waved from the window.

He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge from their houses.

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

""Give it your best shot,"" the 92nd little pig said.  This little pig wasn't going to take the wolf's crap like all his siblings had over the years.  The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.  

The wolf became obsessed with the little pig.  He watched him from the shadows as he went about his life.  He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.  He even stopped blowing down other piggy houses as he couldn't stop thinking about the 92nd little pig.

Finally the wolf decided to make his move in the middle of the night.  He couldn't wait to see the 92nd little pig run from his blown down house, squealing and frantic.  

Around 2 am, the little pig heard a sound in the backyard.  He smiled as he sat up in bed.  Before he could make it to the window he heard a loud bang.  When he looked outside, he saw a pair of tennis shoes and some bits of wolf.  Other pigs started to emerge from their houses.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" I'm gonna blow that house down.""
 And the 92nd little pig was like, ""Nah.""

The wolf was taken aback.  Pigs we supposed to be afraid of him.  They always got concerned when he threatened to blow their houses down.  It was his thing.  He didn't eat the pigs, he just blew down their houses.  

""Yeah, I am gonna blow your house down.""

The wolf didn't know that not only was the house built of depleted uranium, it was also wired to blow up the exact spot that the wolf was preparing to huff and puff.  The little pig was going to be a hero once the wolf was gone.

But the wolf was not stupid.  He was concerned about the little pig's nonchalance about his threats.  So we skulked off.  But he couldn't stop thinking about that pig, sitting fat and happy in his house laughing about the wolf giving up.

He tracked him to the market, he watched as he frolicked with his siblings on the weekends, he tailed him to his job as a mechanic.
