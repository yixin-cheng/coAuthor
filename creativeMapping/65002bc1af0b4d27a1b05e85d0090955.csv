""Sir we are truly in danger. While we made sure to maintain some form of military the last 50 years, it is now clear that our best efforts have still left us behind in both technology and man-power. We must avoid conflict - we will not win.""

The President looked at his military advisor. ""I am aware of the world situation, thank you. But my grandfather, father and now I have all been elected to serve our people. And I will find the path forward.""

While The President and his advisors continue their discussions, the low ranking aides just outside the doors had their own conversation. 
""So what do you think?
 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

The new post-WWIII UN (without the US of course) was also meeting.
""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.
"" Many members agreed with this statement. 
Another nation raised their hand.
 ""But they were not the only ones who supported the war. We were attacked by the Confederation over there, even though we were not supporting or supported by the USA at the time""

And from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war. Which meant they were no longer primary targets. But the other nations... Within 2 weeks the world was in ruin again. With the US relatively unscathed, despite being hated, and never firing a shot in offense or defense.

The President looked at his military advisor. ""I am aware of the world situation, thank you. But my grandfather, father and now I have all been elected to serve our people. And I will find the path forward.""

While The President and his advisors continue their discussions, the low ranking aides just outside the doors had their own conversation. 
""So what do you think?
 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

The new post-WWIII UN (without the US of course) was also meeting.
""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.
"" Many members agreed with this statement. 
Another nation raised their hand.
 ""But they were not the only ones who supported the war. We were attacked by the Confederation over there, even though we were not supporting or supported by the USA at the time""

And from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war. Which meant they were no longer primary targets. But the other nations... Within 2 weeks the world was in ruin again. With the US relatively unscathed, despite being hated, and never firing a shot in offense or defense.

""So what do you think?
 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.
"" Many members agreed with this statement. 
Another nation raised their hand.
 ""But they were not the only ones who supported the war. We were attacked by the Confederation over there, even though we were not supporting or supported by the USA at the time""

And from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war. Which meant they were no longer primary targets. But the other nations... Within 2 weeks the world was in ruin again. With the US relatively unscathed, despite being hated, and never firing a shot in offense or defense.

""So what do you think?
 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.

Another nation raised their hand.
 ""But they were not the only ones who supported the war. We were attacked by the Confederation over there, even though we were not supporting or supported by the USA at the time""

And from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war. Which meant they were no longer primary targets. But the other nations... Within 2 weeks the world was in ruin again. With the US relatively unscathed, despite being hated, and never firing a shot in offense or defense.

The President looked at his military advisor. ""I am aware of the world situation, thank you. But my grandfather, father and now I have all been elected to serve our people. And I will find the path forward.""

While The President and his advisors continue their discussions, the low ranking aides just outside the doors had their own conversation. 
""So what do you think?
 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

The new post-WWIII UN (without the US of course) was also meeting.
""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.
"" Many members agreed with this statement. 
Another nation raised their hand.
 ""But they were not the only ones who supported the war. We were attacked by the Confederation over there, even though we were not supporting or supported by the USA at the time""

And from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war. Which meant they were no longer primary targets. But the other nations... Within 2 weeks the world was in ruin again. With the US relatively unscathed, despite being hated, and never firing a shot in offense or defense.

While The President and his advisors continue their discussions, the low ranking aides just outside the doors had their own conversation. 
""So what do you think?
 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.

And from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war.

 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.

""But that makes us all the better as a target. Someone to blame that they don't have any economic or even blood ties too. They can wipe us out and feel united."" said a gloomy looking aide.

""We are of the clear opinion that the US are responsible for the war and therefore must be punished.

 I mean, I don't really understand the other nations. It has been 50 years, and we obviously aren't the same threat these days."" said one, a young woman with dark hair. 

""Yeah, I mean these days were the peaceful ones. And it's not like they've been living in a utopia. I've read the reports; there are just as many minor wars in the outside world now as there were before WWIII."" said a young man.
