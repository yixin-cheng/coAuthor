They decided to go to a restaurant to eat, both knowing of course who each other is. 

The woman gets to the restaurant. She spots the man in the photo. Turns out it is him. No disguise. The woman ends up liking the mans normal look. The man is shocked to hear this hence why he has confidence issues and has the power to shapeshift. They hit off well this time. They have fun talking and laughing at the table. They talk about how awkward their whole situation has been. But the woman is charmed by this. 

Then all of a sudden a van pulls up to the restaurant.  10 men come out in balaclavas holding various weapons. Guns, bats, pipes, knives, you name it they have it. They decided they are going rob the restaurant and patrons. Of course everyone is shocked. Luckily the man and woman are at the back where the man says wait here he has a plan. He walks off.

She figured out after a while that it was the same guy because he does this weird eye twitch. It is something that even shapeshifting can't hide. But she really does like the guy. It just seems to never work out. And obviously the guy like her too hence why he keeps trying so hard. The woman doesn't know what his true form is. The man has decided no more games and reveal his true self. They set up another date from Tinder where they do all their dates.

He shapeshifts into his real self which is now wearing superhero outfit. He starts taking on the rest of the robbers. He starts off well but is getting overpowered.
