It looked like she had come down with a terrible sickness.  On her birthday, a fever overtook her.  She laid in her bed until she had to urge to run outside.   When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the stratosphere

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.

Rumors about mana arose after the aliens went on their rampage.   It was believed that humans would be able to turn the tables on their enemy.   

In order to wield mana, you had to be descended from someone who could wield mana.  If you had any chance to wield this force, it would happen around your 31st birthday.  So many people were being killed that many people never made it to their 31st birthday.   Thankfully, Caerus survived to her 31st birthday.     

Caerus was descended from the first, rumored mana user.  When Caerus turned 31, she remarked that she started to feel an intense heat inside of her.  It looked like she had come down with a terrible sickness.  On her birthday, a fever overtook her.  She laid in her bed until she had to urge to run outside.   When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the stratosphere

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.  They filled the sky with red energy.   This would be the start of the humans war against the aliens.  The odds have no turned to their favor. ",user,29,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
