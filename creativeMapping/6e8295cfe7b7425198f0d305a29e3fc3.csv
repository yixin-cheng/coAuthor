They form a new Government and act like it has always existed. They inform the immortals that they exist only to take care of the elderly. The immortals do as they are told as they don't know any better. They don't know that they are being used. This works out for a while, at least for the elderly. But once the elderly start to die then the immortals are completely lost. After a couple of decades they are all coming to the few surviving seniors who are still alive. They are into their 100s so they are barely able to remember things themselves. The immortals are desperate for answers. Sadly there aren't any left once those last few seniors die. 

The world is now filled with beautiful immortals who have no memory, not even of yesterday. They just live day to day. Nothing is accomplished. No new technologies are found. No new food is created so they just live off of what they can find. It's a sad life. It's all that they know at this point though.

The immortals do as they are told as they don't know any better. They don't know that they are being used. This works out for a while, at least for the elderly. But once the elderly start to die then the immortals are completely lost. After a couple of decades they are all coming to the few surviving seniors who are still alive. They are into their 100s so they are barely able to remember things themselves. The immortals are desperate for answers. Sadly there aren't any left once those last few seniors die.

No new food is created so they just live off of what they can find. It's a sad life. It's all that they know at this point though.
