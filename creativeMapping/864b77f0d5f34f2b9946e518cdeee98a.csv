You are a young man living in a small village in the north of England at the beginning of the twenty-first century. 

You see yourself waiting for a bus somewhere in West Yorkshire. It is raining. You notice a sparrow fall down from the sky to the ground. You look down, and your eyes tear up. You bend down to pick up the bird, and it flies away. A rainbow appears, far down Great Horton Road, and then the bus arrives. You ride the bus to Leeds.

You get out of the bus, and enter a chemist's shop. ""Codeine Linctus, please"" you ask the person at the prescription counter. The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.
""Codeine Linctus!"" you repeat, louder.
 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.
You walk out of the subway and into a shopping centre.
 A small warmth rises in your chest and you notice that you feel calm and energetic.

You are a young man living in a small village in the north of England at the beginning of the twenty-first century. 

You see yourself waiting for a bus somewhere in West Yorkshire. It is raining. You notice a sparrow fall down from the sky to the ground. You look down, and your eyes tear up. You bend down to pick up the bird, and it flies away. A rainbow appears, far down Great Horton Road, and then the bus arrives. You ride the bus to Leeds.

You get out of the bus, and enter a chemist's shop. ""Codeine Linctus, please"" you ask the person at the prescription counter. The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.
""Codeine Linctus!"" you repeat, louder.
 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.
You walk out of the subway and into a shopping centre.
 A small warmth rises in your chest and you notice that you feel calm and energetic.

Another chemist. Another bottle. Another swallow. The liquid is gone.
A third chemist.

You are a young man living in a small village in the north of England at the beginning of the twenty-first century. 

You see yourself waiting for a bus somewhere in West Yorkshire. It is raining. You notice a sparrow fall down from the sky to the ground. You look down, and your eyes tear up. You bend down to pick up the bird, and it flies away. A rainbow appears, far down Great Horton Road, and then the bus arrives. You ride the bus to Leeds.

You get out of the bus, and enter a chemist's shop. ""Codeine Linctus, please"" you ask the person at the prescription counter. The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.
""Codeine Linctus!"" you repeat, louder.
 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.
You walk out of the subway and into a shopping centre.
 A small warmth rises in your chest and you notice that you feel calm and energetic.

You get out of the bus, and enter a chemist's shop. ""Codeine Linctus, please"" you ask the person at the prescription counter. The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.
""Codeine Linctus!"" you repeat, louder.
 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.

You see yourself waiting for a bus somewhere in West Yorkshire. It is raining. You notice a sparrow fall down from the sky to the ground. You look down, and your eyes tear up. You bend down to pick up the bird, and it flies away. A rainbow appears, far down Great Horton Road, and then the bus arrives. You ride the bus to Leeds.

You get out of the bus, and enter a chemist's shop. ""Codeine Linctus, please"" you ask the person at the prescription counter. The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.
""Codeine Linctus!"" you repeat, louder.
 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.
You walk out of the subway and into a shopping centre.
 A small warmth rises in your chest and you notice that you feel calm and energetic.

 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.

You see yourself waiting for a bus somewhere in West Yorkshire. It is raining. You notice a sparrow fall down from the sky to the ground. You look down, and your eyes tear up. You bend down to pick up the bird, and it flies away. A rainbow appears, far down Great Horton Road, and then the bus arrives. You ride the bus to Leeds.

You get out of the bus, and enter a chemist's shop. ""Codeine Linctus, please"" you ask the person at the prescription counter. The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.
""Codeine Linctus!"" you repeat, louder.
 The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.
You walk out of the subway and into a shopping centre.
 A small warmth rises in your chest and you notice that you feel calm and energetic.

Another chemist. Another bottle. Another swallow. The liquid is gone.
A third chemist.
 You are feeling good.

Suddenly it is evening, and you see yourself returning to your home, set in some row houses on a cobbled street called St. Margaret's Place. The house is dark.

Sitting in the cinema, you are appalled. The lights go up.
