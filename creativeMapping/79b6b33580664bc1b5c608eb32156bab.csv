He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""102nd",user,22,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug",user,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Da",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rom, PA. ",user,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended u ",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. After",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. After a",user,28,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were.

 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet.

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. 

After a few weeks people settled into their roles as not number one Dad, but tried everyday to make the number on the side of their mugs go up.

Maybe this wasn't a prank at all, but a hint that we all need to be better dads and make sure our kids are taken care of. 

So, if you are looking for a way to be a better dad, look no further than your mug.",api,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
