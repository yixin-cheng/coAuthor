It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Da",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it!

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.

Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 D",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash.

He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Phil, PA. ",user,25,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, ",user,25,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress.

Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up ",user,25,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.

 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the p ",user,25,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. After a f",user,27,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet.

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet.

Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.

 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work.

As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.

He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were.

""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it.

 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash.

He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. 

After a few weeks people settled into their roles as not number one Dad, but tried everyday to make the number on the side of their mugs go up.

It seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his ""#1 Dad"" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash.

As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying ""#1 Dad"" it said ""#5467 Dad"" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said ""#5467 Dad"". He was dumbfounded. ""They really went all in on this prank"" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. 
He got dressed and headed off to work.


As he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said ""Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says ""#8243 Dad"" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said ""#1 Dad"" on it but I could only find this one that said ""#12845 Dad"" on it"" tears were welling up in his eyes.
""Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon."" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.
As he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out.
 Everyone was comparing how ""Dadly"" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his ""#102 Dad"" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.
He entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was
 the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real ""#1 Dad"" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.
