She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something.""

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise.

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued.

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

text-delete,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued.

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally comitted to you, and I'll always be there for you.

Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone.

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued.

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shapedated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh,",user,47,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you.

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect out for h. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you ",user,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional coupl",user,49,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be hio",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued.

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone.

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

text-insert,"A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""

Tracy was stunned.

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he changed shape and dated her again she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.

He entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. ""It'll be ok, I can make this work,"" he though to himself as they sat down.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.

They chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. ""Oh no,"" she thought ""he is going to ask me to move in.""

Jeff took a deep breath. ""We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something."" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. ""This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.""

Tracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. 

He continued ""It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally committed to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.""
Tracy was stunned.
 It was...perfect, the perfect solution for her situation. Almost too perfect. But she would take it. For as long as it would last. ""Oh, Jeff, you didn't need to worry so much. I love you, for who you are. And if that means we're not a traditional couple that is fine. To be honest, I'm not eager to change my life that way either.""

She was nervous. She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone. She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him. She was afraid to say no, but she was also afraid to say yes. She didn't want to lose him, but she was almost certain to slip and let him see her abilities if they lived together. 

She looked up to see Jeff come in the coffeshop door.

Jeff stood outside the door for a while calming his breathing. He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again.
