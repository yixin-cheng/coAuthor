""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.

Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Humans are now discovering that they have the power to travel back in time.  This has become true for one man in particular, Bob.  Bob didn't realize he had this power until the day that he lost his favorite sunglasses.  But when he slips back to the day where he first found them, something unexpected happens.  He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.

Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.

Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.

 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.

 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bob didn't realize he had this power until the day that he lost his favorite sunglasses.  But when he slips back to the day where he first found them, something unexpected happens.  He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. W",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in t",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  H",user,37,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bob didn't realize he had this power until the day that he lost his favorite sunglasses.  But when he slips back to the day where he first found them, something unexpected happens.  He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious",user,37,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.

Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.
Coming back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here.
 Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

He couldn't figure out how to come back to the present time.  Traveling through time was such a new power for humans that he didn't know what to do.  He sat on a nearby bench after putting on his newly found sunglasses to think about it for a bit.
""Do you have any idea what time it is?""
 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.  Maybe he had to find his home.  And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

 he asked a passerby.
""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

""It is time for you to go home,"" she replied.
Bob was confused. He wanted to get home.  But just then, a though popped into his head.  Maybe, just maybe, that was a clue for him to be able to find his way back to the present time.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.

Bob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  

""I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,"" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.

Bob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.  Bob was surprised that he had returned to the present time. ""I discovered the key to time travel and didn't even know it,"" Bob said to himself.
