You begin wo wonder what is in store for your next life? Will it be the same as one of your previous lives? You will probably look similar but will you know the same people? Will you live in the same town? Will your choice of partner seem as inexplicable as it did in a previous life?

There is much in your previous lives that seems inexplicable but you have heard everything happens for a reason. You are comforted by the thought that each life has led up to this one. You know that wherever you go that is where you are supposed to be.

As you watch yourself go through life this time around, your past lives begin to slip away. With each new life previous lives become more distant.

You begin wo wonder what is in store for your next life? Will it be the same as one of your previous lives? You will probably look similar but will you know the same people? Will you live in the same town? Will your choice of partner seem as inexplicable as it did in a previous life?

There is much in your previous lives that seems inexplicable but you have heard everything happens for a reason. You are comforted by the thought that each life has led up to this one. You know that wherever you go that is where you are supposed to be. 
You remember the previous life in which your pet dog died.
 You really hope in this life you will meet again. 
You suddenly have a thought.
 Maybe each time you live you will have more love to give. In this life the love you have for a dog will be that dog as well as all other dogs you have ever had.
Maybe one day you will even be able to love yourself.
 It has been hard because you carry thoughts of all the things you wish you had done.  You decide this next life will be the best yet. You will forgive yourself for prior failures and bring all of your experience into this next life.
