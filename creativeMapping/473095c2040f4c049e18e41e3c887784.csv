""It's true you are human, but you are also the reincarnation of our Queen. You have always been the Queen of the Bees, but you were reincarnated into a human body. Now that we have found our way back to you, you are ready to take your rightful place as the Queen of the Bees.""

""What about my allergy?"" you ask. ""It's a lie,"" the bee responds. ""It's a lie that has been told to you your entire life by the humans that raised you."" You ponder this. ""Why would my mom lie to me?"" ""Because your mother is the reincarnation of our mortal enemy, the Queen of the Wasps."" You gasp.

The bee continues. ""There has long been a feud between our two species, and it is prophesized that one day, a Queen of the Bees will rise up and unite us all, and lead us to victory against the wasps. You had the mark at birth, and that drew the Queen of the Wasps to your mother's form, and she possessed her, and lied to you, and guarded you your whole life to keep you from us.""

""But now, we are here, and we will follow you into battle."" ""We?"" you ask. ""Yes, we,"" the bee responds.

The bee flies off your shoulder and lands on your hand. You are petrified with fear, but the bee reassures you. ""Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm here to serve you. I'm one of your loyal drones, and I will do anything you command.""

You're confused, of course, but something about the bee calms you. ""What's this about?"" you ask. ""Why am I Your Majesty?"" The bee explains that you are the Queen of the Bees, and that you are the one who controls the hive. ""How can that be, I'm human! And allergic to bees!"" The bee responds. ""It's true you are human, but you are also the reincarnation of our Queen. You have always been the Queen of the Bees, but you were reincarnated into a human body. Now that we have found our way back to you, you are ready to take your rightful place as the Queen of the Bees.""

The bee continues. ""There has long been a feud between our two species, and it is prophesized that one day, a Queen of the Bees will rise up and unite us all, and lead us to victory against the wasps.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" Startled, you look around. ""Who said that?"" you exclaim. The bee flies off your shoulder and lands on your hand. You are petrified with fear, but the bee reassures you. ""Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm here to serve you. I'm one of your loyal drones, and I will do anything you command.""

You're confused, of course, but something about the bee calms you. ""What's this about?"" you ask. ""Why am I Your Majesty?"" The bee explains that you are the Queen of the Bees, and that you are the one who controls the hive. ""How can that be, I'm human! And allergic to bees!"" The bee responds. ""It's true you are human, but you are also the reincarnation of our Queen. You have always been the Queen of the Bees, but you were reincarnated into a human body. Now that we have found our way back to you, you are ready to take your rightful place as the Queen of the Bees.""

""What about my allergy?"" you ask. ""It's a lie,"" the bee responds. ""It's a lie that has been told to you your entire life by the humans that raised you."" You ponder this. ""Why would my mom lie to me?"" ""Because your mother is the reincarnation of our mortal enemy, the Queen of the Wasps."" You gasp.

The bee continues. ""There has long been a feud between our two species, and it is prophesized that one day, a Queen of the Bees will rise up and unite us all, and lead us to victory against the wasps. You had the mark at birth, and that drew the Queen of the Wasps to your mother's form, and she possessed her, and lied to you, and guarded you your whole life to keep you from us.""

""But now, we are here, and we will follow you into battle."" ""We?"" you ask. ""Yes, we,"" the bee responds. You hear a vast buzzing, and the room fills with bees, flying, hovering, awaiting your command. You are filled with a sense of power, and a sense of purpose. This feels right, somehow. This is what you have been waiting for your whole life. You eye the door, and your army, and think of the woman who stole your mother,  and lied to you your whole life.

The battle against her begins now. You open the door, and march out, and your army follows you.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" Startled, you look around. ""Who said that?"" you exclaim. The bee flies off your shoulder and lands on your hand. You are petrified with fear, but the bee reassures you. ""Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm here to serve you. I'm one of your loyal drones, and I will do anything you command.""

You're confused, of course, but something about the bee calms you. ""What's this about?"" you ask. ""Why am I Your Majesty?"" The bee explains that you are the Queen of the Bees, and that you are the one who controls the hive. ""How can that be, I'm human! And allergic to bees!"" The bee responds. ""It's true you are human, but you are also the reincarnation of our Queen. You have always been the Queen of the Bees, but you were reincarnated into a human body. Now that we have found our way back to you, you are ready to take your rightful place as the Queen of the Bees.""

""What about my allergy?"" you ask. ""It's a lie,"" the bee responds. ""It's a lie that has been told to you your entire life by the humans that raised you."" You ponder this. ""Why would my mom lie to me?"" ""Because your mother is the reincarnation of our mortal enemy, the Queen of the Wasps."" You gasp.

The bee continues. ""There has long been a feud between our two species, and it is prophesized that one day, a Queen of the Bees will rise up and unite us all, and lead us to victory against the wasps. You had the mark at birth, and that drew the Queen of the Wasps to your mother's form, and she possessed her, and lied to you, and guarded you your whole life to keep you from us.""

""But now, we are here, and we will follow you into battle."" ""We?"" you ask. ""Yes, we,"" the bee responds. You hear a vast buzzing, and the room fills with bees, flying, hovering, awaiting your command. You are filled with a sense of power, and a sense of purpose. This feels right, somehow. This is what you have been waiting for your whole life. You eye the door, and your army, and think of the woman who stole your mother,  and lied to you your whole life.

The bee flies off your shoulder and lands on your hand. You are petrified with fear, but the bee reassures you. ""Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm here to serve you.

""It's true you are human, but you are also the reincarnation of our Queen. You have always been the Queen of the Bees, but you were reincarnated into a human body. Now that we have found our way back to you, you are ready to take your rightful place as the Queen of the Bees.""

The bee continues. ""There has long been a feud between our two species, and it is prophesized that one day, a Queen of the Bees will rise up and unite us all, and lead us to victory against the wasps.

""But now, we are here, and we will follow you into battle."" ""We?"" you ask. ""Yes, we,"" the bee responds. You hear a vast buzzing, and the room fills with bees, flying, hovering, awaiting your command. You are filled with a sense of power, and a sense of purpose. This feels right, somehow. This is what you have been waiting for your whole life. You eye the door, and your army, and think of the woman who stole your mother,  and lied to you your whole life.

The battle against her begins now. You open the door, and march out, and your army follows you.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" Startled, you look around. ""Who said that?"" you exclaim. The bee flies off your shoulder and lands on your hand. You are petrified with fear, but the bee reassures you. ""Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm here to serve you. I'm one of your loyal drones, and I will do anything you command.""

You're confused, of course, but something about the bee calms you. ""What's this about?"" you ask. ""Why am I Your Majesty?"" The bee explains that you are the Queen of the Bees, and that you are the one who controls the hive. ""How can that be, I'm human! And allergic to bees!"" The bee responds. ""It's true you are human, but you are also the reincarnation of our Queen. You have always been the Queen of the Bees, but you were reincarnated into a human body. Now that we have found our way back to you, you are ready to take your rightful place as the Queen of the Bees.""

""What about my allergy?"" you ask. ""It's a lie,"" the bee responds. ""It's a lie that has been told to you your entire life by the humans that raised you."" You ponder this. ""Why would my mom lie to me?"" ""Because your mother is the reincarnation of our mortal enemy, the Queen of the Wasps."" You gasp.
