The United States, under the command of Colonel Bowers, decides to collect all the scientific minds in order to create a device that will turn back time. 
Once this device is created, the Colonel and his troops will return to the past in order to prevent World War III from ever happening.
World War III would have severe consequences in so many different ways on the United States and all the other countries involved.

Obviously lives will be lost. People will lose limbs. PTSD will affect many. But there will also be much more damage done. Economies will crash. Society will struggle. Generations of people will be affected long-term and not in a positive way. Without a doubt, this war will change many things for the worse.

And sure, some countries will be on the winning side of the war.  But at the end of the day they won't have anything meaningful to show for it. Sacrifices will be made and all because of a war.

Luckily, Colonel Bowers has that device that will turn back time and prevent this War from ever happening. And he is determined to make this happen no matter what. He goes through the time machine and is able to meet with all of the countries that were supposed to be present in World War III.

And sure, some countries will be on the winning side of the war.  But at the end of the day they won't have anything meaningful to show for it. Sacrifices will be made and all because of a war.
