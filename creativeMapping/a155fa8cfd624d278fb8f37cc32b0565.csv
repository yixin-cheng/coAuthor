After years of knowing that you may not really be the best dad, but still a good one, the truth is in a clear number right in front of you. #8675310. 

Not only is that a horribly low number, but also 1 number below a familiar tune. t's a song that you used to like, and it's now being sung by a slightly higher ranked Dad.
 You need to be the better dad. You know you can't be the best in the world, the proof is right there. But, you CAN be the #8675309th best dad in the world if you try hard enough!

You sit your kids down and ask them how you can help them, what have you done wrong, how have you hurt them? They don't have any one major issue with you, not one big glaring flaw. They just say that Dad, you're not the best dad. hey tell you they love you, and that everything is fine, but it's really not.
 

All those late days at work , the extra hours, all those times you were too busy to play catch, the time you said ""I'm tired"" instead of ""I'd love too"" , the missed picnics, the lame excuses. Every one of those moments is now a number on a mug. Visual proof of the father's that did make the effort. 

This changes now. You WILL be a better dad! Not tomorrow. TODAY! You believe in yourself, you voice your thoughts to your family and they too believe in you. You don't have to be the best, you just have to be better. 

The next morning you walk downstairs to make coffee and a big breakfast for the family. You turn on the radio and hear the opening intro of a familiar song ""Jenny Jenny who can I turn to?"" you grab your #1 dad mug and smile as you glance at the number you feel a surge through your chest.
