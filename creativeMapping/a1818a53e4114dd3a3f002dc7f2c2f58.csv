This was strange, because I, Barack Obama, had just recently been thinking that I would like to pack my bags and go on an adventure. I don't know how JFK had known this, or why he might have taken it upon himself to have me rousted out of my retirement, but...wait. Then I realized JFK had been long gone for a long time.

This all sounded very strange but like I said I was ready for an adventure so I took off to meet JFK at his secret time machine base. here was a lot of information to process.
 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. ""So where do we dig?"", I asked JFK.
""Oh, outside my secret time machine base."", he repliedd. So we got our shovels and started to dig. 
It wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it.
 ""We have to get this time crystal back to the future."", I said. So JFK and I got it into his time machine and went back to the future with the time crystal. e arrived in the future to find that it was a terrible place full of despair and anguish.

 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now.

This was strange, because I, Barack Obama, had just recently been thinking that I would like to pack my bags and go on an adventure. I don't know how JFK had known this, or why he might have taken it upon himself to have me rousted out of my retirement, but...wait. Then I realized JFK had been long gone for a long time.

I picked up the phone and dialed.
 ""Hello, it's JFK and I'm calling to let you know your next mission. I'm from the future where they have restored my consciousness into a robot. I'm the only one who can save humanity from the alien invaders who have stolen our bodies and are using their consciousness to rule over us.""

This all sounded very strange but like I said I was ready for an adventure so I took off to meet JFK at his secret time machine base. here was a lot of information to process.
 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. ""So where do we dig?"", I asked JFK.
""Oh, outside my secret time machine base."", he repliedd. So we got our shovels and started to dig. 
It wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it.
 ""We have to get this time crystal back to the future."", I said. So JFK and I got it into his time machine and went back to the future with the time crystal. ehen w arrived in the future twetfound hat it was a terrible place full of despair and anguish.

This was strange, because I, Barack Obama, had just recently been thinking that I would like to pack my bags and go on an adventure. I don't know how JFK had known this, or why he might have taken it upon himself to have me rousted out of my retirement, but...wait. Then I realized JFK had been long gone for a long time. How could this be? Was someone playing a joke on me?
I picked up the phone and dialed.
 ""Hello, it's JFK and I'm calling to let you know your next mission. I'm from the future where they have restored my consciousness into a robot. I'm the only one who can save humanity from the alien invaders who have stolen our bodies and are using their consciousness to rule over us.""

This all sounded very strange but like I said I was ready for an adventure so I took off to meet JFK at his secret time machine base. here was a lot of information to process.
 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. ""So where do we dig?"", I asked JFK.
""Oh, outside my secret time machine base."", he repliedd. So we got our shovels and started to dig. 
It wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it.
 ""We have to get this time crystal back to the future."", I said. So JFK and I got it into his time machine and went back to the future with the time crystal. ehen w arrived in the future twetfound hat it was a terrible place full of despair and anguish.

This was strange, because I, Barack Obama, had just recently been thinking that I would like to pack my bags and go on an adventure. I don't know how JFK had known this, or why he might have taken it upon himself to have me rousted out of my retirement, but...wait. Then I realized JFK had been long gone for a long time.

This all sounded very strange but like I said I was ready for an adventure so I took off to meet JFK at his secret time machine base. here was a lot of information to process.
 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. ""So where do we dig?"", I asked JFK.
""Oh, outside my secret time machine base."", he repliedd. So we got our shovels and started to dig. 
It wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it.
 ""We have to get this time crystal back to the future."", I said. So JFK and I got it into his time machine and went back to the future with the time crystal. ehen w arrived in the future twetfound hat it was a terrible place full of despair and anguish.

This all sounded very strange but like I said I was ready for an adventure so I took off to meet JFK at his secret time machine base. here was a lot of information to process.
 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. ""So where do we dig?"", I asked JFK.
""Oh, outside my secret time machine base."", he repliedd. So we got our shovels and started to dig. 
It wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it.
 ""We have to get this time crystal back to the future."", I said. So JFK and I got it into his time machine and went back to the future with the time crystal. ehen w arrived in the future twetfound hat it was a terrible place full of despair and anguish.

 ""Hello, it's JFK and I'm calling to let you know your next mission. I'm from the future where they have restored my consciousness into a robot. I'm the only one who can save humanity from the alien invaders who have stolen our bodies and are using their consciousness to rule over us.""

This all sounded very strange but like I said I was ready for an adventure so I took off to meet JFK at his secret time machine base. here was a lot of information to process.
 He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. ""So where do we dig?"", I asked JFK.
""Oh, outside my secret time machine base."", he repliedd. So we got our shovels and started to dig. 
It wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it.
 ""We have to get this time crystal back to the future."", I said. So JFK and I got it into his time machine and went back to the future with the time crystal. ehen w arrived in the future twetfound hat it was a terrible place full of despair and anguish.
 JFK walked me to a place with many other crystals. He held the one we found in the air and poof! The crystals all combined! Everyone was immediately saved from the aliens because Obama helped JFK bring the crystal back to the future saving all of huObama was able to return home but he never spoke of his amazing story of saving the future.
