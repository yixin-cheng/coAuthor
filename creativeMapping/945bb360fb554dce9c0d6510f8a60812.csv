But for others, it was one that confused them and was a source of mystery, as they could not explain the odd phenomenon that had occurred one day in the year 2050.

For in that year, all the mugs in the world that once said #1 Dad in various languages, changed to reflect a different type of rank.

It was all over on social media, countless people making posts that showed pictures of their new mug, with numbers that were quite different from the number 1 the mug used to say. Many of the users that made post online were dads, who were surprised to see their true dad rank. Out of the billions of people living in the world, it was thousands that had found that their mugs that had changed. Those who were unaffected were saddened that they could not know how they rank as a father, but would soon be relieved that they avoided the conflict that arose later.

Many dads ended up fighting over one another over the rank they were given, some claiming that they were the true #1 dad, while others claimed that they were simply better than there peers and friends. The fighting ranged from being physical, to psychological, with countless arguments on social media between the dads who could not accept the rank listed on the mug. The fighting went on for days, which then turned to months. Many were seriously injured from the fighting, while countless relationships including friendships and other social interactions were soured. However, once again, the mugs ended up changing once again.

This time, the mugs all showed a different number, for some being quite higher or lower than others. Posts were made again online , with people showing off their new mug. People were confused if the ranks were updated based on what had occurred since the first time. They also wondered if the mugs would change once again.

Those that believed the mugs would change were correct, as three months later the ranks were updated again. The same was true after three more months since then. People concluded that the changing months updated and reflected the rank of dads around the world , every three months. This would end up having a positive change on the world, as people began to accept their rank, and the possibility they could improve it.

But for others, it was one that confused them and was a source of mystery, as they could not explain the odd phenomenon that had occurred one day in the year 2050.

For in that year, all the mugs in the world that once said #1 Dad in various languages, changed to reflect a different type of rank.

It was all over on social media, countless people making posts that showed pictures of their new mug, with numbers that were quite different from the number 1 the mug used to say.

Those that believed the mugs would change were correct, as three months later the ranks were updated again. The same was true after three more months since then. People concluded that the changing months updated and reflected the rank of dads around the world , every three months.

But for others, it was one that confused them and was a source of mystery, as they could not explain the odd phenomenon that had occurred one day in the year 2050.

For in that year, all the mugs in the world that once said #1 Dad in various languages, changed to reflect a different type of rank.

It was all over on social media, countless people making posts that showed pictures of their new mug, with numbers that were quite different from the number 1 the mug used to say. Many of the users that made post online were dads, who were surprised to see their true dad rank. Out of the billions of people living in the world, it was thousands that had found that their mugs that had changed. Those who were unaffected were saddened that they could not know how they rank as a father, but would soon be relieved that they avoided the conflict that arose later.

Many dads ended up fighting over one another over the rank they were given, some claiming that they were the true #1 dad, while others claimed that they were simply better than there peers and friends. The fighting ranged from being physical, to psychological, with countless arguments on social media between the dads who could not accept the rank listed on the mug. The fighting went on for days, which then turned to months. Many were seriously injured from the fighting, while countless relationships including friendships and other social interactions were soured. However, once again, the mugs ended up changing once again.

This time, the mugs all showed a different number, for some being quite higher or lower than others. Posts were made again online , with people showing off their new mug. People were confused if the ranks were updated based on what had occurred since the first time. They also wondered if the mugs would change once again.

Those that believed the mugs would change were correct, as three months later the ranks were updated again. The same was true after three more months since then. People concluded that the changing months updated and reflected the rank of dads around the world , every three months. This would end up having a positive change on the world, as people began to accept their rank, and the possibility they could improve it.

But for others, it was one that confused them and was a source of mystery, as they could not explain the odd phenomenon that had occurred one day in the year 2050.

For in that year, all the mugs in the world that once said #1 Dad in various languages, changed to reflect a different type of rank.

It was all over on social media, countless people making posts that showed pictures of their new mug, with numbers that were quite different from the number 1 the mug used to say. Many of the users that made post online were dads, who were surprised to see their true dad rank. Out of the billions of people living in the world, it was thousands that had found that their mugs that had changed. Those who were unaffected were saddened that they could not know how they rank as a father, but would soon be relieved that they avoided the conflict that arose later.

Many dads ended up fighting over one another over the rank they were given, some claiming that they were the true #1 dad, while others claimed that they were simply better than there peers and friends. The fighting ranged from being physical, to psychological, with countless arguments on social media between the dads who could not accept the rank listed on the mug. The fighting went on for days, which then turned to months. Many were seriously injured from the fighting, while countless relationships including friendships and other social interactions were soured. However, once again, the mugs ended up changing once again.

This time, the mugs all showed a different number, for some being quite higher or lower than others. Posts were made again online , with people showing off their new mug. People were confused if the ranks were updated based on what had occurred since the first time. They also wondered if the mugs would change once again.

Those that believed the mugs would change were correct, as three months later the ranks were updated again. The same was true after three more months since then. People concluded that the changing months updated and reflected the rank of dads around the world , every three months. This would end up having a positive change on the world, as people began to accept their rank, and the possibility they could improve it. While some dads would still fight and argue for their rank, they eventually realized it was futile as they would get a lower rank the next time the mugs of the world changed.
