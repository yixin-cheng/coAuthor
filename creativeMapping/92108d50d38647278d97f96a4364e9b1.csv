""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.
