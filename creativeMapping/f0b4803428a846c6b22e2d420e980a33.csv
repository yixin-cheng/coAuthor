The Americans were surprised that they were the only ones who maintained strict isolation.    The Russians were busy taking up all of Europe, and the Chinese had already colonized Africa.  While America was isolated, they were able to focus on becoming independent from other nations.  They weren't dependent on any fuel sources from other nations.  In fact, they had developed a new fuel source called hadronium.  Hadronium was a block of solid fuel that could be used as a power source for anything from cars to spaceships.  The fuel was very easy to transfer and manufacture.

A single drop of hadronium allowed the average car driver to drive for one year.  The outside word seemed to still be utilizing fossil fuels.  That is the primary reason why the Chinese had colonized Africa.  While the Americans were isolated, they had no contact with the Canadians.  It seemed that climate change had thawed out many of the cold areas of Canada.   They had access to more land than they did before.  

When America first isolated, the American made a deal with the Canadians that they would safeguard Alaska until America got out of isolation.   When America exited isolation, Canada convinced them that they had done a better job of protecting Alaska than the Americans.  Our current leaders agreed.  They allowed Canada to keep Alaska.  They only asked that Canada would give up half of the natural resources produced in Alaska.  The Canadians agreed.

When America came out of isolation, Russia and China started to become more tense.  However, they were much more willing to enter into a peace treaty to ensure there would not be a World War IV.  They also were enticed with hadronium.  They were very willing to make a deal.   All of the countries on earth signed the Anti-War Pact of 2300.
