You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody know",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke. 

You end up calling the number and a disguised voice answers the phone. 
""Good morning Mr. President.
 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. T",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke. 

You end up calling the number and a disguised voice answers the phone. 
""Good morning Mr. President.
 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

""Good morning Mr. President.
 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. This is exactly what you feared. You wondered why JFK would do this. You called the number that he left you and there was",user,39,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke. 

You end up calling the number and a disguised voice answers the phone.

 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. This is exactly what you feared. You wondered why JFK would do this. You called the number that he left you and there was no answer. The phone was disconnected.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. This is exactly what you feared. You wondered why JFK would do this. You called the number that he left you and there was no answer. The phone was disconnected.

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke. 

You end up calling the number and a disguised voice answers the phone.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke.

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke. 

You end up calling the number and a disguised voice answers the phone. 
""Good morning Mr. President.
 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. This is exactly what you feared. You wondered why JFK would do this. You called the number that he left you and there was no answer. The phone was disconnected.

You're stunned. JFK has been dead for years. His death can even be viewed on YouTube. His head was basically blown off while riding in a car. How could this be? It has to be a joke. 

You end up calling the number and a disguised voice answers the phone. 
""Good morning Mr. President.
 We would like you to speak to John F. Kennedy. He has something to ask you.""

You sit there in disbelief, still thinking this is a joke. A man who is supposedly JFK picks up the phone and starts speaking to you. You start quizzing him on facts about the real JFK and he nails every one. He explains to you that his death was a set up.

He couldn't handle the pressures that came with being President of the United States. He had his death set up so that he could leave the public eye and live his life in a foreign country. He basically entered witness protection.

You start to think this is the real JFK and as time goes on he continually tells you things that only the real JFK would know. He tells you that the government has been very good at hiding things from the public and that it's time to change all of that. He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people.
