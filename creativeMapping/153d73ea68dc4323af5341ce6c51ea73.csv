The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.

But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again.

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode.

 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again.

The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his house, but he also did not want to stay there because it was a radioactive pigsty.

But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty.

The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Mattyneeded to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.

He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode.

 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies.

 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!""

 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.

The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The le",user,46,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again.

 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies.

With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea.

With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with",user,46,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode.

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty.

The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work.

 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again.

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade.

The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty.

 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work.

And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade.

But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And t",user,52,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again.

That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And that is h",user,52,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade.

The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade.

He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And that is the story of how the 92nd little pig, 9",user,52,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And that is the story of how the 92nd little pig, 93rd litt",user,52,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade.

That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And that is the story of how the 92nd little pig, 93rd little pig, ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And that is the story of how the 92nd little pig, 93rd little pig, and 945 ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.

Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation.

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll

And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out.

 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them.
