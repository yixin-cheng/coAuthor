The bee speaks again. ""Your Majesty, the hive is in danger. The Queen has been captured by a group of humans. We need you to lead us to her."" This all seems very strange, but for some reason, you don't question it. ""All right.."" you say. ""Let's go.""  he bee flies off your shoulder and lbuzzes towards the window, pausing for a moment to look back at you over its shoulder, or whatever bees have in place of shoulders.

She buzzes appreciatively and the two of you zoom off to see what's happening in your home, the wasp's nest",user,39,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You're confused.  You don't know what to do. Did a bee just talk to me? More importantly, will I be stung? You're frozen in bewilderment and fear.
