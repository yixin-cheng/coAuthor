  While border security had been an issue before, now that people throughout the world found out what strides America had made, people started flocking to the borders.  The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.  He first had to make sure no one from the outside world could attack America, then he was going to try and open up trade with the rest of the world.  While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

But then President Young thought back to the days of the Donald Trump presidency, when he had built a wall with Mexico and not shown empathy with those who had good reason to escape their countries.  He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.  He first had to make sure no one from the outside world could attack America, then he was going to try and open up trade with the rest of the world.  While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

But then President Young thought back to the days of the Donald Trump presidency, when he had built a wall with Mexico and not shown empathy with those who had good reason to escape their countries.  He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

Within 6 months, Young's plan was put into place.  Immigrants were considered and many had skills to further advance US interests.  Rather than getting the dregs of other countries, he found he was getting the best of the best.  Ameri",user,19,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

  While border security had been an issue before, now that people throughout the world found out what strides America had made, people started flocking to the borders.  The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.

While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

  While border security had been an issue before, now that people throughout the world found out what strides America had made, people started flocking to the borders.  The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.  He first had to make sure no one from the outside world could attack America, then he was going to try and open up trade with the rest of the world.  While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

But then President Young thought back to the days of the Donald Trump presidency, when he had built a wall with Mexico and not shown empathy with those who had good reason to escape their countries.  He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

Within 6 months, Young's plan was put into place.  Immigrants were considered and many had skills to further advance US interests.  Rather than getting the dregs of other countries, he found he was getting the best of the best.

  While border security had been an issue before, now that people throughout the world found out what strides America had made, people started flocking to the borders.  The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.  He first had to make sure no one from the outside world could attack America, then he was going to try and open up trade with the rest of the world.  While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

Within 6 months, Young's plan was put into place.  Immigrants were considered and many had skills to further advance US interests.  Rather than getting the dregs of other countries, he found he was getting the best of the best.
