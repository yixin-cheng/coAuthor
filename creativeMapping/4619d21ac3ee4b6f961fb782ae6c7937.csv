The Tyrants had the majority of us got killed for quite such a short time. They were powerful, and they were ruthless. But when humans started to glow, we realize we could fight back. Every human has a unique power. Some can control the elements, some can manipulate the weather, and some can even heal. I did not know my power until I was attacked by a Tyrant. I had a huge cut in my arm and I was bleeding out. To stop the Tyrant from further attacks, I tried to imagine a wall of stone blocking the alien from me. Suddenly, the ground started to shake and a huge wall of stone rose from the ground. The Tyrant was trapped in the stone, and I was safe.
