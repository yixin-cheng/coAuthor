 The bee twirled about excitedly. 
""You are to be married!""
 the bee smiled and flapped its wings. ""Married?! This is untrue!"" The queen was furious. Who would go starting such a ridiculous rumor? ""Your Majesty, it is true! Just look at your hand.""

The queen looked at her hand. There, on her finger, was a ring. Astonishing! She had never seen it before. ""Where did this come from? I don't understand. What's going on?"" The bee explained. ""Your wedding day has long been approaching. It's high time you  had yourself a proper husband and king."" 
""But I don't want a husband.
 I pride myself on my independence."" the queen said with her head held high. ""Your Majesty, you will be a good wife and queen. Besides, the family has offered to throw in a private island and a new castle for you and your beloved."" 

The queen thought for a moment, and finally let out a long sigh. ""Well, I suppose I could do with a husband. Alright, when do I meet him?""
