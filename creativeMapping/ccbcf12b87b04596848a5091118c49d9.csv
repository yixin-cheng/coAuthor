""Your wedding day has long been approaching. It's high time you  had yourself a proper husband and king."" 
""But I don't want a husband.
 I pride myself on my independence."" the queen said with her head held high. ""Your Majesty, you will be a good wife and queen. Besides, the family has offered to throw in a private island and a new castle for you and your beloved."" 

The queen thought for a moment, and finally let out a long sigh. ""Well, I suppose I could do with a husband. Alright, when do I meet him?""
