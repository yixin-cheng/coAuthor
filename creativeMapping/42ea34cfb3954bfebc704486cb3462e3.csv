Dads all over the world were shocked. How did it happen? Some blame the economy, others say it's because of a gender bias. Some even blamed voodoo witch doctors, where ever the finger could be pointed.

Some dad mugs still said #1 though. Scientist started looking into the reason behind it. The reason the Dad mugs no longer said #1 was found out., kind of. At least the reasons behind it was clear even if no one understood how it happened. 

You see, what they found out was that the mugs really started to show how good of a dad a man was to his kids. The mugs were a window into the dad's soul. If he did not care about his children, then his mug would give a really low rating like #384657, or something like that.
If a dad really cared about his children a lot then the mug would say a really high number like dad #3 or 9 or even 7. 
Now, there were some dads who did nohave a #1 mug.
