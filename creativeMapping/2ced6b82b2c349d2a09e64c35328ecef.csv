text-insert,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. My dad's ranking is at the bottom of the list. It was hardly surprising, he was not present most of the time when I was growing up, and still today he still has very little relationship with my 2-year old son, Toby. Over the years I tried to spend more time with him but he always found some excuse to avoid spending time with me, especially recently and I am writing this from a hotel room in England, where I am on. I specifically flew here in my hometown to visit him but he just doesn't want to. I asked him what is his reaction about the mug thing and he just said, ""I don't care.""

I don't know if he means that he doesn't care about the mug, or he doesn't care about being a father. I was very angry about the mug thing but I realize that it wouldn't do any good. My husband's dad also showed up around the bottom of the list, with just a few million separating him from my dad, but his relationship with my husband and with our kid is getting better.

I just wish me and my dad is the same. There are so many stories that I want to tell about Toby. Last week, he just started to say ""I love you"" and now he does it 24/7. I was also trying to train him in the potty and after a day he already knows what to do. I wanted to day that he reminds me of his grandpa. But I won't give him that satisfaction.

I don't know if he means that he doesn't care about the mug, or he doesn't care about being a father. I was very angry about the mug thing but I realize that it wouldn't do any good.

I just wish me and my dad is the same. There are so many stories that I want to tell about Toby. Last week, he just started to say ""I love you"" and now he does it 24/7.

I know for a fact that my father does not even know when Toby's birthday is. I had to call him a week later after Toby was born to give him the news. He wasn't even excited.

I just wish me and my dad is the same. There are so many stories that I want to tell about Toby. Last week, he just started to say ""I love you"" and now he does it 24/7. I was also trying to train him in the potty and after a day he already knows what to do. I wanted to day that he reminds me of his grandpa. But I won't give him that satisfaction. I know for a fact that my father does not even know when Toby's birthday is. I had to call him a week later after Toby was born to give him the news. He wasn't even excited. All he said at the time was, ""Oh, well, that is nice.""

Over the years I tried to spend more time with him but he always found some excuse to avoid spending time with me, especially recently and I am writing this from a hotel room in England, where I am on. I specifically flew here in my hometown to visit him but he just doesn't want to. I asked him what is his reaction about the mug thing and he just said, ""I don't care.""

I don't know if he means that he doesn't care about the mug, or he doesn't care about being a father. I was very angry about the mug thing but I realize that it wouldn't do any good. My husband's dad also showed up around the bottom of the list, with just a few million separating him from my dad, but his relationship with my husband and with our kid is getting better.

I just wish me and my dad is the same. There are so many stories that I want to tell about Toby. Last week, he just started to say ""I love you"" and now he does it 24/7.
