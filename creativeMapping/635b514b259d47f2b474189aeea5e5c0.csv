I look at them, and suddenly feel snotice what she is talking about
 Instead of the words, ""World's Best Mom"", it now reads something like, ""World's 112817928th best  Mom"". My mug that used to read #1 dad now says #397898798th best Dad. 
""I think these are the real rankings"", she says.
  ""You'll...always be #1 to me?"" I joke weakly, trying to lighten the mood.
""I think I'm going to go curl up in the fetal position now"", she says.
 ""My mom is on her way over, and she demands to know why we sent her a mug that says 'World's worst Grandma' on it"". 
I ""Does that mean..."" I say, ""That if these rankings are true, she is literally the worst grandma in the entire world?"" ""I'm pretty sure that about sums it up"", she says. ""Oh my lord.""

 I see Grandma's car pull up. I'm going to need a drink for this.  Two drinks actually, since I need a drink to deal with Christy's mother on a good day. This should be interesting!
