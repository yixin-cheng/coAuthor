The kidnapping happened on a sunny Tuesday in Los Angeles. Matt was headed for the restroom in his agent's office, and never returned. His agent, Ari Gold, panicked. He took out a crumpled sheet of paper, read the number on it, and dialed it on his iPhone.

""Hi,"" said a familiar voice from the other end. 

""Matt?"" said Ari. ""Where the hell are you?"".
""I'm in the back of an alien's spaceship,"" said Matt Damon.
 ""I can see Earth out a small porthole. ""It seems to be getting smaller.""
""Can you see the alien?"" asked Ari.


""That aliens, plural,"" whispered Matt. ""There's three of them.  One of them is green, one of them is red, and one of them is blue.""

""Are you recording this?"" finished Matt in  a throaty whisper.
""Yeah,"" mumbled Ari, ""I'm recording this.

""Excellent"" said Matt. Ari could hear the smile in his voice.
""What's going on?"", asked Ari.
 ""And since when is there cellular reception in outer space, anyway?""
""Probably when the alien ship is parked right outside the International Space Station,"" replied Matt.
