The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

""Man, you saved my life,"" he told the wolf, and invited him over to his house for dinner the next night.  The wolf was shocked.

  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

""I'm glad to hear that, but why, may I ask, are you leaving my house alone?"" 

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

""Man, you saved my life,"" he told the wolf, and invited him over to his house for dinner the next night.  The wolf was shocked.  None of the pigs had ever thanked him for anything or been nice to him.  He agreed and visited the pig's house the next night.  They had a nice dinner and over coffee and cake, they chatted about why the wolf blew down everyone's house.  The pig said that he'd been told that the wolf was a bad guy who blew down houses just to be mean.

""I'm glad to hear that, but why, may I ask, are you leaving my house alone?"" 

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

""Man, you saved my life,"" he told the wolf, and invited him over to his house for dinner the next night.  The wolf was shocked.  None of the pigs had ever thanked him for anything or been nice to him.  He agreed and visited the pig's house the next night.  They had a nice dinner and over coffee and cake, they chatted about why the wolf blew down everyone's house.  The pig said that he'd been told that the wolf was a bad guy who blew down houses just to be mean.  

""Nah,"" the wolf said, ""I'm just bored and lonely.  It's tough being the only wolf in a pig town.""

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm not going to blow that house down.""
  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

""I'm glad to hear that, but why, may I ask, are you leaving my house alone?"" 

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

""Man, you saved my life,"" he told the wolf, and invited him over to his house for dinner the next night.  The wolf was shocked.  None of the pigs had ever thanked him for anything or been nice to him.  He agreed and visited the pig's house the next night.  They had a nice dinner and over coffee and cake, they chatted about why the wolf blew down everyone's house.  The pig said that he'd been told that the wolf was a bad guy who blew down houses just to be mean.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm not going to blow that house down.""
  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

""I'm glad to hear that, but why, may I ask, are you leaving my house alone?"" 

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

The pig said that he'd been told that the wolf was a bad guy who blew down houses just to be mean.  

""Nah,"" the wolf said, ""I'm just bored and lonely.  It's tough being the only wolf in a pig town.""

  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

""I'm glad to hear that, but why, may I ask, are you leaving my house alone?"" 

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

""Man, you saved my life,"" he told the wolf, and invited him over to his house for dinner the next night.  The wolf was shocked.  None of the pigs had ever thanked him for anything or been nice to him.  He agreed and visited the pig's house the next night.  They had a nice dinner and over coffee and cake, they chatted about why the wolf blew down everyone's house.  The pig said that he'd been told that the wolf was a bad guy who blew down houses just to be mean.  

""Nah,"" the wolf said, ""I'm just bored and lonely.  It's tough being the only wolf in a pig town.""  

The pig realized that the wolf wasn't the only bad guy.  The town of pigs had made the wolf an outcast and weren't nice to him.  At the next town hall meeting, the pig brought this up.  He said he thought the wolf would stop blowing down houses if he were integrated into the community.  Pigs started to get to know the wolf and realized he wasn't a bad guy.
