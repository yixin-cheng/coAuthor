You are a young man who has just died in a car accident.
 You find out that you are in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You soon find out that you are all your previous reincarnations, and you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. The reincarnations all await in suspense of the revealed characteristics of the next reincarnation. Could our family be rich? Would we have pets? Are we going to have great parents who are supportive and we love? Or maybe its on the other spectrum. Maybe our parents are not good parents, or maybe we dont even have parents. Maybe we grow up in a dangerous neighborhood, or in a dangerous country. 

I sit there and await just as the other me's are awaiting. Its weird. visially these all seem like different people standing here with me, however our thoughts are interconnected in a weird way that i can not explain at this point in time. Im pretty sure we are all separate, but i am pretty sure also that we are all linked in someway. I want to know which way though, and i want to know whether this reincarnation is something that we all experience, or just some of us. Am i going to be this reincarnation in first person? Which of these reincarnations will have total control? I am just so confused i feel like i am in a mental institution. I remember the car crash but i dont remember what happened after. I just know that now i am here and here I am. All of a sudden the car that i was in before my death flashes on the screen in front of all the reincarnations. The crash itself is played on video. I am seen being destroyed in the car, and my soul leaves my body. The faces of my family and friends are all visible on the screen, and my body itself is even shown.

You are a young man who has just died in a car accident.
 You find out that you are in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You soon find out that you are all your previous reincarnations, and you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. The reincarnations all await in suspense of the revealed characteristics of the next reincarnation. Could our family be rich? Would we have pets? Are we going to have great parents who are supportive and we love? Or maybe its on the other spectrum. Maybe our parents are not good parents, or maybe we dont even have parents. Maybe we grow up in a dangerous neighborhood, or in a dangerous country. 

I sit there and await just as the other me's are awaiting. Its weird. visially these all seem like different people standing here with me, however our thoughts are interconnected in a weird way that i can not explain at this point in time. Im pretty sure we are all separate, but i am pretty sure also that we are all linked in someway. I want to know which way though, and i want to know whether this reincarnation is something that we all experience, or just some of us. Am i going to be this reincarnation in first person? Which of these reincarnations will have total control? I am just so confused i feel like i am in a mental institution. I remember the car crash but i dont remember what happened after. I just know that now i am here and here I am. All of a sudden the car that i was in before my death flashes on the screen in front of all the reincarnations. The crash itself is played on video. I am seen being destroyed in the car, and my soul leaves my body. The faces of my family and friends are all visible on the screen, and my body itself is even shown. An image of my soul is depicted as it vanishes into thin air. My reincarnations continue to await in suspense, and I assume that the next reincarnation will appear next.  I wonder about what if there is no other reincarnation, what if i was the last one? What will happen to all of me, or us? Will we just be stuck here in this cinema forever? Will we just dissapear? Will we just die? ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You are a young man who has just died in a car accident.
 You find out that you are in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You soon find out that you are all your previous reincarnations, and you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. The reincarnations all await in suspense of the revealed characteristics of the next reincarnation. Could our family be rich? Would we have pets? Are we going to have great parents who are supportive and we love? Or maybe its on the other spectrum. Maybe our parents are not good parents, or maybe we dont even have parents. Maybe we grow up in a dangerous neighborhood, or in a dangerous country. 

I sit there and await just as the other me's are awaiting. Its weird. visially these all seem like different people standing here with me, however our thoughts are interconnected in a weird way that i can not explain at this point in time. Im pretty sure we are all separate, but i am pretty sure also that we are all linked in someway. I want to know which way though, and i want to know whether this reincarnation is something that we all experience, or just some of us. Am i going to be this reincarnation in first person? Which of these reincarnations will have total control? I am just so confused i feel like i am in a mental institution. I remember the car crash but i dont remember what happened after. I just know that now i am here and here I am. All of a sudden the car that i was in before my death flashes on the screen in front of all the reincarnations. The crash itself is played on video. I am seen being destroyed in the car, and my soul leaves my body. The faces of my family and friends are all visible on the screen, and my body itself is even shown. An image of my soul is depicted as it vanishes into thin air. My reincarnations continue to await in suspense, and I assume that the next reincarnation will appear next.  I wonder about what if there is no other reincarnation, what if i was the last one? What will happen to all of me, or us? Will we just be stuck here in this cinema forever? Will we just dissapear? Will we just die? I have so many questions, and no answers. Maybe this is the end that nobody knows about.",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
