 His name is Martin Onondaga. He was born just two years after the invasion, and educated in a secret school in Wisconsin's Manitowoc County.
He is the first of a new generation of humans to wield the power of Mana.
 Using the power, he released every person held captive anywhere in the world. These became his servants. Wielding of the great power of Mana, they were able to overcome their captors and set up bases in every corner of the globe.
