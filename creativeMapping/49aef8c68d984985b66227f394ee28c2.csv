Can you first tell me what the heck is going on right now? I asked the Bee. The Bee looked at me and said ""You are now the Queen of the Bees. I am your loyal servant."" I looked at the Bee and said ""What do you mean i am the Queen of the Bees? I am not a Bee!"" The bee looked at me with amusement, almost in laughter. ""You are the Queen of the Bees.
