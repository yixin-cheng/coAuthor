he United States is under the dictatorial control of a man named President Hudson, who has begun to advocate for his own dictatorship over all of
 the world. 
President Hudson's control is challenged by an uprising in the Rocky Mountains, led by a man named David Sawyer.
 Sawyer's army includes his partner, Nate Madock; his lover, Kate Warner; former girlfriend, Anne Matheson (who is also a CIA). 
The United States is in a state of turmoil, with the President's loyalists centered in New York City and the rebels based out of Idaho
.
he resistance begins small, with Sawyer's rebels attacking critical infrastructure and government targets, but soon becomes a full-scale war.

n a last ditch effort to quell the uprising, President Hudson orders the use of nuclear weapons on Sawyer's stronghold in Idaho.

Sawyer and his army escape the nuclear blast, but are trapped underground.
 While in the caves, David and Kate uncover the message of a long-dead man known as The Prophet. The Prophet's message calls people to action, to rise up against corrupt governments and oppressive regimes. A hologram of the Prophet also offers secret technology to David. 
The resistance eventually re-emerges to challenge President Hudson.
 The resistance makes contact with other resistance movements around the globe, and they unite under the banner of The Prophet. he Prophet's technology includes the ability to create self-replicating nanobots, that can be used as super weapons.
 The resistance, now unified, uses the nanobots to attack New York City. 
The nanobots attack by targeting the city's infrastructure, and cause the city to plunge into darkness.
 The President and his forces are left powerless without electricity. The city's people, who are now starving and freezing, rise up against the President. 
Meanwhile, Sawyer's forces attack the United Nations building in New York City, targeting President Hudson.
 Hudson attempts to escape, but Sawyer captures him. Sawyer brings the President to the United Nations in New York City, where Sawyer's forces have taken control of the building. Sawyer puts President Hudson on trial for crimes against humanity. Hudson is sentenced to death. 

Following the trial, Sawyer leads his army to Zürich, Switzerland. Sawyer's forces attack a secret compound in Switzerland, and release another hologram from storage. The hologram is of the Prophet's daughter, and she offers Sawyer more technology, including a supercomputer that has the entire sum of human knowledge. Sawyer and his army learn from the supercomputer that Earth is heading for an ecological disaster, but that the nanobots can be programmed to clean the oceans and forests. 

After the control of the corrupt governments is broken, David uses the technology from the Prophet to reprogram the bots to save the world. ""No man should have all this power"" He says.
