I was not looking forward to seeing mine. Mine was stuck in my cupboard for almost a year now as I broke the handle of the mug. I couldn't bring myself to throw it away. It was given to me by my mother-in-law and I was sure she would be upset if I threw it away. 

It was all the talk with my coworkers this morning. They all compared each other's dad ranking the same way they talk comparing their junk. I was asked by Steve. I said, ""I'm not sure, but I'm sure it's not the best."" Apparently he was the #2,300,332. Rumors in the office that Tom was ranking the highest in our office at #45,032. I am not surprised. He is a good dad.

It's finally the end of the workday and I was dreading to come home. I said to myself, ""I'll just get home, open the door, and see what my ranking is."" 

I opened my cupboard and there was my ranking. I tried washing the mug as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

""World's #0 Dad,"" it said.

I cried and cried. Tears won't stop and tears did not stop for hours. I was reminded that I no longer have my son. He died in a car accident a few years ago. It was my fault. He was angry at me that day and probably too angry to be driving. My last conversation with my son was about how I was a terrible father. I would never forget his last words, ""I hate you. You are the worst dad in the world.""

I cried and cried. Tears won't stop and tears did not stop for hours. I was reminded that I no longer have my son. He died in a car accident a few years ago. It was my fault. He was angry at me that day and probably too angry to be driving. My last conversation with my son was about how I was a terrible father. I would never forget his last words, ""I hate you. You are the worst dad in the world.""

I was not looking forward to seeing mine. Mine was stuck in my cupboard for almost a year now as I broke the handle of the mug. I couldn't bring myself to throw it away. It was given to me by my mother-in-law and I was sure she would be upset if I threw it away.

I said, ""I'm not sure, but I'm sure it's not the best."" Apparently he was the #2,300,332. Rumors in the office that Tom was ranking the highest in our office at #45,032. I am not surprised. He is a good dad.

It's finally the end of the workday and I was dreading to come home. I said to myself, ""I'll just get home, open the door, and see what my ranking is.""
