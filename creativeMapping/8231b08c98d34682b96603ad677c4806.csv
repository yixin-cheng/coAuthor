You are now the queen bee, and you must guide your bee-clan to the safety of a nearby flower. You don't understand how this happened. The last you remembered, you were a human. Now, you're a bee. You have no idea what you're doing and you're supposed to be guiding an entire clan of bees. 
You're not alone.
 You have a bunch of bees following you. But ultimately you know that you're just flying around with no purpose. And you have no idea why all these bees are following you. You just know that you're now the Queen bee.

You're also wondering to yourself what happened. Why are you a bee? You go back to the bee that landed on your shoulder and ask him what happened. He tells you that he stung you and that turned you into a bee.

He was a royal bee so whatever human he stung became a bee. And all of those bees in my clan...they all were stung by each other. This royal bee is trying to turn all humans into bees. Why? World domination. 

He tells you ""Humans have been oppressing bees for so long, now it's time for bees to dominant over humans."" You think for a bit and understand his point of view. Humans are always swatting at bees, spraying them with water and ultimately viewing them as the enemy. In reality these bees just want to pollinate flowers and create honey.

You are the Queen bee now but you want to go back to being a human. You think fast and decide to sting the queen bee. To your surprise, this changes you back into your human form. You run for your life with the royal bee chasing you and are able to escape into a river. You swim down the river and the bee tries to sting you but you keep going under the water each time.

He was a royal bee so whatever human he stung became a bee. And all of those bees in my clan...they all were stung by each other. This royal bee is trying to turn all humans into bees. Why? World domination. 

He tells you ""Humans have been oppressing bees for so long, now it's time for bees to dominant over humans."" You think for a bit and understand his point of view. Humans are always swatting at bees, spraying them with water and ultimately viewing them as the enemy. In reality these bees just want to pollinate flowers and create honey.

You are the Queen bee now but you want to go back to being a human. You think fast and decide to sting the queen bee. To your surprise, this changes you back into your human form. You run for your life with the royal bee chasing you and are able to escape into a river. You swim down the river and the bee tries to sting you but you keep going under the water each time.
