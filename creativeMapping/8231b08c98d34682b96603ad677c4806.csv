You're not alone.
 You have a bunch of bees following you. But ultimately you know that you're just flying around with no purpose. And you have no idea why all these bees are following you. You just know that you're now the Queen bee.

You're also wondering to yourself what happened. Why are you a bee? You go back to the bee that landed on your shoulder and ask him what happened. He tells you that he stung you and that turned you into a bee.

He was a royal bee so whatever human he stung became a bee. And all of those bees in my clan...they all were stung by each other. This royal bee is trying to turn all humans into bees. Why? World domination. 

He tells you ""Humans have been oppressing bees for so long, now it's time for bees to dominant over humans."" You think for a bit and understand his point of view. Humans are always swatting at bees, spraying them with water and ultimately viewing them as the enemy. In reality these bees just want to pollinate flowers and create honey.
