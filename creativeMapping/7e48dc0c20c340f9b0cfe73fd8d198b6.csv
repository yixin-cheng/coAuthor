Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it.""

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news.

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet.""

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

""But how can that be?"" I asked myself. ""I know for a fact that he's in the top of the list.""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet.""

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

""But how can that be?"" I asked myself. ""I know for a fact that he's in the top of the list.""

I rotated the mug and it turns out it listed all of the children the dads have.

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

""But how can that be?"" I asked myself. ""I know for a fact that he's in the top of the list.""

I rotated the mug and it turns out it listed all of the children the dads have.

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

""But how can that be?"" I asked myself. ""I know for a fact that he's in the top of the list.""

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""

I cut to the chase. ""Why are you hiding what rank you are, dad?""

""You're still on that silly ranking, honey?"" He replied and continued asking why am I there.

I searched their house and I had a hard time looking for the mug. But as soon as I found it, my dad was near the bottom of the list.

I remember giving my dad his #1 Dad mug a few Christmases ago. I was eager to call him right after I heard the news. 

""Dad, I just heard the news. Have you had a look at your cup? What does it say?""

My dad hesitantly said, ""Well, I haven't had a look at it yet. I'll look at it later, honey. Listen, I need to go. I'll call you later, I love you.""

He was very apprehensive over the phone, almost as if he was hiding something from me. ""Well, probably nothing. I am just overthinking it."" I said to myself.

Dad did not call back. The next morning I tried to call again, but the same thing, ""I'll call you back, honey. I haven't looked at it yet."" 

I said, ""But aren't you curious? I swear you must be in the top five. I know it."" 

My parent's house is on a different state and after a week of pushing I still did not get an answer. It's August and I did not have any reason to go home but I was tired of what's going on and need to know what my dad's ranking is. I booked a plane and went to their house the weekend I was free. 

For the very first time, Dad wasn't smiling and grinning when he saw me. His daughter, the daughter he's always proud of. He would always be smiling and be so happy to see me. But this time, he was almost pale when he saw me.

""What... what's wrong, dad?"" I asked. He replied, ""Nothing, honey.""
