 Not all countries hates China and will surely back them up.

So the troops will be disguised as Korean troops which China will not see as a threat. All of the vehicles are disguised as well. They make it to the government building. Then the firing starts. The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.

China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years.

One thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training. All the ships, tanks, and submarines are still theirs. And no countries like the UK, Japan, Canada, and many others want the US to be number one again. So they device a plan to attack China. China is still oblivious to all of this. They are in their own bubble thinking that everything is going swell. The plan is to attack China's capital when they least expect it.

The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. China is defeated.

One thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others.

One thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training.

China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years.

One thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years.

So the troops will be disguised as Korean troops which China will not see as a threat. All of the vehicles are disguised as well. They make it to the government building. Then the firing starts. The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. China is defeated.

One thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training.

China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years.
