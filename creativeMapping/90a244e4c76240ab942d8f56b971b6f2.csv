You're sure that if you watch too long you'll lose yourself completely. Maybe this is a way to control your fate, you wonder... Thinking on this you realize that you could never command control forever; eventually you'd lose focus, fall asleep, get hit by a bus... you could never have control forever, but you could have it for a moment.

 You suppose it would only matter so much, as waking up could be a new life, a continuation, not that you'd know the difference. You look at the big screen. There, you can see your new life unfold, before it's even begun. The more you stare, the more you become attached to it, and the harder it is to look away! You're sure that if you watch too long you'll lose yourself completely. Maybe this is a way to control your fate, you wonder... Thinking on this you realize that you could never command control forever; eventually you'd lose focus, fall asleep, get hit by a bus... you could never have control forever, but you could have it for a moment. That thought pleases you, so long as a moment doesn't extend into a future that you feel compelled to control. The movie ends, and you look at the blank screen. The movie picks up exactly where you watched it last, no change despite hearing it in the background! Now you're sure that you must succumb to the story.
