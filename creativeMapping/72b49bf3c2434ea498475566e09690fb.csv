You look around. You see your past selves, all watching the new life. Some seem more focused than others. You wonder if they are going to be reincarnated again. Wait, where did that though come from. If they were all you, then how could they be someone else too? 

You look back at the screen. The person is grown now in living in a large city; much larger than any you ever lived in. That got you thinking, about the number of people in the world, and how they all must have souls. You wonder if you are the only one in this room. The only soul that is; are you all just one soul with multiple bodies?

That didn't feel like the right answer. You look around the room again. You felt you were definitely connected to them all, but also very different. And you thought about all the past yous, and all the past lives of everyone you ever met, and why you would be here watching another life, getting the chance to learn from their mistakes as well as your own.

The only soul that is; are you all just one soul with multiple bodies?

That didn't feel like the right answer. You look around the room again. You felt you were definitely connected to them all, but also very different. And you thought about all the past yous, and all the past lives of everyone you ever met, and why you would be here watching another life, getting the chance to learn from their mistakes as well as your own.

And that's when it came to you. You watched one of your former selves suddenly smile, and walk through the exit door fading out. And you noticed a new movie screen appear in the room, next to the first and another new life started playing out. 

Everyone was connected. Connected to each other, the past, and the future. A soul gives birth to another, its twin at first, but then growing and changing as all twins do. It was a web of life, and you helped to shape it as well as be shaped by it.
