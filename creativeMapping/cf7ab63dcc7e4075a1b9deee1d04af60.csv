You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time. In fact, you remember her doing something like this before, and you smile and shake your head. Malia is sharp as a whip, which is perhaps why she's a Harvard Law student now. You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time.

You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor.

She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time. In fact, you remember her doing something like this before, and you smile and shake your head. Malia is sharp as a whip, which is perhaps why she's a Harvard Law student now. You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time.

You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants.

You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy.

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time.

You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor.

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time.

You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy.

You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it.

She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy.

You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt.

You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon.

You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy.

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time. In fact, you remember her doing something like this before, and you smile and shake your head. Malia is sharp as a whip, which is perhaps why she's a Harvard Law student now. You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy. Malia and Matt have prepared a delicious meal of chicken parmesan and pasta, along with a delicious tiramisu for dessert. You and Michelle c",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy. Malia and Matt have prepared a delicious meal of chicken parmesan and pasta, along with a delicious tiramisu for dessert. You and Michelle congratulat",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time. In fact, you remember her doing something like this before, and you smile and shake your head. Malia is sharp as a whip, which is perhaps why she's a Harvard Law student now. You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor.

You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant.

You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy. Malia and Matt have prepared a delicious meal of chicken parmesan and pasta, along with a delicious tiramisu for dessert.

You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy. Malia and Matt have prepared a delicious meal of chicken parmesan and pasta, along with a delicious tiramisu for dessert.

You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time.

text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time. In fact, you remember her doing something like this before, and you smile and shake your head. Malia is sharp as a whip, which is perhaps why she's a Harvard Law student now. You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy.

You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy. Malia and Matt have prepared a delicious meal of chicken parmesan and pasta, along with a delicious tiramisu for dessert.

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants. Matt says that he wants you to show up at the following address: 220 West 79th Street, Unit 2, New York, New York 10024. He tells you it's important and that you should come with Michelle. You ask when you should arrive and Matt says at 7pm that evening. Matt tells you that you ought to dress up for the occasion. You ask what the occasion is and Matt says that he can't tell you. You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy.

You tell Michelle that you will be going out that evening and that she should prepare to wear her best. Michelle asks for details but you say she knows just as much as you do. You tell her that she should wear her best dress and that you will wear your best suit.

That night, you and Michelle show up at 220 West 79th Street, and you arrive at Unit 2. You see Malia and Matt at the apartment. You're surprised to see that Malia is pregnant. You ask her how long she's been pregnant and she says that she's been pregnant for about four months. She says that she's been keeping it a secret from you and that she was planning on telling you tonight. You ask whose apartment this is and Malia says that she and Matt are renting this apartment from a woman named Soeurette Morley, who is somewhat crazy. Malia says that her living situation is not the best given Soeurette's mental health issues and instabilities so she and Matt are planning to move to another apartment in New York soon. But for now, Malia just wants to treat you and Michelle to a nice dinner so you can celebrate becoming grandparents. You're surprised to hear that you're going to be a grandparent, but you're happy. Malia and Matt have prepared a delicious meal of chicken parmesan and pasta, along with a delicious tiramisu for dessert. You and Michelle congratulate your daughter on her pregnancy, and the two of you toast to each other becoming grandparen",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" You look at the note and are flabbergasted, but only for a moment. You know that your daughter Malia likes to prank you all the time. In fact, you remember her doing something like this before, and you smile and shake your head. Malia is sharp as a whip, which is perhaps why she's a Harvard Law student now. You chuckle to yourself and think about how she's going to be a great lawyer. You dial the number on the note and hear a familiar voice on the other end. It's clearly Malia's boyfriend, Matt. You've met him before, and he's a great kid. He's a little older than Malia, but you're glad that she's found someone to be with. He's a kind, hardworking young man who's going to be a doctor. You're sure that Malia will be a great lawyer, but Matt will be a great doctor. He's already got the bedside manner for it. 

Regardless, Matt introduces himself as JFK. You decide to play along and ask him what he wants.
