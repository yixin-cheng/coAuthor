And he told me that he was still alive but this had been kept a secret from the public because the real JFK was.. an alien!He told me about how he was taken in a UFO and they revealed to him the secrets of the universe.
 And that humans kidnapped him as an alien baby in order to make him their future president. His alien family had vowed to take revenge at just the right moment and according to JFK, that moment would soon arrive.""How can I help?"" I asked.
 
""You have to save the Earth from my family. They will blow up the planet in 10 days if you don't stop them."" 
""Where are they?"" I asked. ""The mother ship is over the Pyramids of Egypt.,"" said JFK. 
So I came up with a plan. I couldn't confront them directly, or they would blow up the planet. So instead I decided to get some scientists to help me develop a force field to protect the planet from the aliens. It took a lot of work but I convinced some scientists to help me.

So I, Barack Obama, packed my things and got ready to see what this was all about. I had nothing better going on and wanted to see if this was somehow the real JFK.
 used the number on the letter, and he picked up personally.
 ""How can this be?"" I asked the dead president. ""I thought you were dead and buried."" And he told me that he was still alive but this had been kept a secret from the public because the real JFK was.. an alien!He told me about how he was taken in a UFO and they revealed to him the secrets of the universe.
 And that humans kidnapped him as an alien baby in order to make him their future president. His alien family had vowed to take revenge at just the right moment and according to JFK, that moment would soon arrive.""How can I help?"" I asked.
 
""You have to save the Earth from my family. They will blow up the planet in 10 days if you don't stop them."" 
""Where are they?"" I asked. ""The mother ship is over the Pyramids of Egypt.,"" said JFK. 
So I came up with a plan. I couldn't confront them directly, or they would blow up the planet. So instead I decided to get some scientists to help me develop a force field to protect the planet from the aliens. It took a lot of work but I convinced some scientists to help me. We traveled to the pyramids and the scientists and their engineers built a magical force field and put it into place around the Earth. When the aliens arrived and tried to blow up the planet, they discovered their plan was foiled by the force field.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

So I, Barack Obama, packed my things and got ready to see what this was all about. I had nothing better going on and wanted to see if this was somehow the real JFK.
 used the number on the letter, and he picked up personally.
 ""How can this be?"" I asked the dead president. ""I thought you were dead and buried."" And he told me that he was still alive but this had been kept a secret from the public because the real JFK was.. an alien!He told me about how he was taken in a UFO and they revealed to him the secrets of the universe.
 And that humans kidnapped him as an alien baby in order to make him their future president. His alien family had vowed to take revenge at just the right moment and according to JFK, that moment would soon arrive.""How can I help?"" I asked.
 
""You have to save the Earth from my family. They will blow up the planet in 10 days if you don't stop them."" 
""Where are they?"" I asked. ""The mother ship is over the Pyramids of Egypt.,"" said JFK. 
So I came up with a plan. I couldn't confront them directly, or they would blow up the planet. So instead I decided to get some scientists to help me develop a force field to protect the planet from the aliens. It took a lot of work but I convinced some scientists to help me. We traveled to the pyramids and the scientists and their engineers built a magical force field and put it into place around the Earth. When the aliens arrived and tried to blow up the planet, they discovered their plan was foiled by the force field.
