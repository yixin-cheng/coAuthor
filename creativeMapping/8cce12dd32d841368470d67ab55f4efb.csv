My 15th birthday is today.


 look at the bee and say ""I command you to tell me what you know about my father.""
  The bee proceeds to tell me that my father had assisted his bee colony decades ago.   Human beings were encroaching on their hive and threatening to destroy it.  My father helped to scare the humans away which saved the bee colony.  The bees were no ordinary bees.  They had magically powers.  They granted my father the power to communicate with animals and insects due to his help on that day.

The bee then tells me that my father is the reason that I have the gift of communicating with animals and insects.

  The bee proceeds to tell me that my father had assisted his bee colony decades ago.   Human beings were encroaching on their hive and threatening to destroy it.

My 15th birthday is today.


 look at the bee and say ""I command you to tell me what you know about my father.""
  The bee proceeds to tell me that my father had assisted his bee colony decades ago.   Human beings were encroaching on their hive and threatening to destroy it.  My father helped to scare the humans away which saved the bee colony.  The bees were no ordinary bees.  They had magically powers.  They granted my father the power to communicate with animals and insects due to his help on that day.

The bee then tells me that my father is the reason that I have the gift of communicating with animals and insects.
  I felt a flood of emotions rush over me.  I had always thought my father was crazy for the stories he told me about animals.  It turns out he was telling the truth.   I felt a surge of excitement.  My life, which seemed so boring before, has taken a new direction.  I told the bee to go back to the hive and await further orders from me.
