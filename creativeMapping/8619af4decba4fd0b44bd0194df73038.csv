 David is a ""Mana Sensitive"", meaning he can sense the presence of mana in the world around him. This ability is very rare, and is the reason that David is constantly being hunted by the aliens. he story begins with David's father, a powerful mage, being killed by the aliens.
 David is then forced to flee from the aliens, and he soon meets up with a group of other people who are also Mana Sensitives. Together, they form a resistance against the aliens, and try to find a way to defeat them. This group aims to save all of humanity from these aliens and must work together to do so. They hope to use their mana sensitive powers to build the strength of their group even stronger. 

With a group of mana sensitive survivors, not even an entire world of aliens would be able to defeat them. The larger they can get their group, the faster they can take over. The main goal is to remain safe from large numbers of aliens until they can strengthen their group. They must travel to a variety of places to do this because there can be survivors all around the world. So far, there are ten of them, and with these ten they have the power to run an entire country.
