This will surely be some sort of catastrophe and create a hierarchy of dads, some insisting that their ranking is wrong because their lawn is nicer than their neighbor's or that they can grill a better steak. This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand. 
t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.

He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.

This will surely be some sort of catastrophe and create a hierarchy of dads, some insisting that their ranking is wrong because their lawn is nicer than their neighbor's or that they can grill a better steak. This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.

If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.

Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.

This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well,",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he di",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just th",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off with",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hjt",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.

Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, exc",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see h",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This will surely be some sort of catastrophe and create a hierarchy of dads, some insisting that their ranking is wrong because their lawn is nicer than their neighbor's or that they can grill a better steak. This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.

This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.
 He walked into his kitchen, opened his cupboard, and retrieved his dad mug. He turned it over and looked at the new number on his mug and consulted the neighborhood guide to translate the new ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.
 He walked into his kitchen, opened his cupboard, and retrieved his dad mug. He turned it over and looked at the new number on his mug and consulted the neighborhood guide to translate the new number to allign with t",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place.

My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank.

If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.
 He walked into his kitchen, opened his cupboard, and retrieved his dad mug. He turned it over and looked at the new number on his mug and consulted the neighborhood guide to translate the new number to align with the neighborhood ranking system. H",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.

This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.
 He walked into his kitchen, opened his cupboard, and retrieved his dad mug. He turned it over and looked at the new number on his mug and consulted the neighborhood guide to translate the new number to align with the neighborhood ranking system.

 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

One day, my neighbor discovered some secrets on how to raise his dad rank. My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.
 He walked into his kitchen, opened his cupboard, and retrieved his dad mug. He turned it over and looked at the new number on his mug and consulted the neighborhood guide to translate the new number to align with the neighborhood ranking system. 

He smiled. His mug ranked number 1. Mario's reign was about to ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
