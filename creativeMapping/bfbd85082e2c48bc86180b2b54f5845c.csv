The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff is highly explosive and you risk destroying the whole forest that we all live in. ""no, no, no!"" said the pig. You will eat me if I try to build another house. No said the wolf I will actually help you. This is not about me being hungry, its about the safety of the forest. 
The little pig was still very suspious but also remembers 9th grade science class when they discussed nuclear fission and the atom bomb. After a night of relfection the little piggy calls out to the wolf who was still waiting outside his home and says that we should talk. The wolf says that he will do whatever he can to keep this forest from being destroyed. The pig then responded, you are right, we need to rebuild my house using a safe material. The wolf quickly agreed and jumped to his feet. I will start collecting some sand to make bricks said the wolf. I will start collecting the other materials to mix the sand with.

The wolf quickly agreed and jumped to his feet. I will start collecting some sand to make bricks said the wolf. I will start collecting the other materials to mix the sand with.

The wolf quickly agreed and jumped to his feet. I will start collecting some sand to make bricks said the wolf. I will start collecting the other materials to mix the sand with.

""no, no, no!"" said the pig. You will eat me if I try to build another house. No said the wolf I will actually help you. This is not about me being hungry, its about the safety of the forest. 
The little pig was still very suspious but also remembers 9th grade science class when they discussed nuclear fission and the atom bomb. After a night of relfection the little piggy calls out to the wolf who was still waiting outside his home and says that we should talk. The wolf says that he will do whatever he can to keep this forest from being destroyed. The pig then responded, you are right, we need to rebuild my house using a safe material. The wolf quickly agreed and jumped to his feet. I will start collecting some sand to make bricks said the wolf. I will start collecting the other materials to mix the sand with. 
After about an hour they met back up at near the piggy's home and started to clear a way for his new house.

""no, no, no!"" said the pig. You will eat me if I try to build another house. No said the wolf I will actually help you. This is not about me being hungry, its about the safety of the forest. 
The little pig was still very suspious but also remembers 9th grade science class when they discussed nuclear fission and the atom bomb. After a night of relfection the little piggy calls out to the wolf who was still waiting outside his home and says that we should talk. The wolf says that he will do whatever he can to keep this forest from being destroyed. The pig then responded, you are right, we need to rebuild my house using a safe material. The wolf quickly agreed and jumped to his feet. I will start collecting some sand to make bricks said the wolf. I will start collecting the other materials to mix the sand with. 
After about an hour they met back up at near the piggy's home and started to clear a way for his new house.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff is highly explosive and you risk destroying the whole forest that we all live in. ""no, no, no!"" said the pig. You will eat me if I try to build another house. No said the wolf I will actually help you. This is not about me being hungry, its about the safety of the forest. 
The little pig was still very suspious but also remembers 9th grade science class when they discussed nuclear fission and the atom bomb. After a night of relfection the little piggy calls out to the wolf who was still waiting outside his home and says that we should talk. The wolf says that he will do whatever he can to keep this forest from being destroyed. The pig then responded, you are right, we need to rebuild my house using a safe material. The wolf quickly agreed and jumped to his feet. I will start collecting some sand to make bricks said the wolf. I will start collecting the other materials to mix the sand with.
