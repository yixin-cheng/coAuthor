text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

The side effects that happen are shocking, and almost unbelievable. They include things like when you turn 85 , you fall into a coma, and when you wake up, you're a baby. While yes, you could consider this immortality, it's not exactly what science had in mind. They developed the drug from the immortal jelly fish called Turritopsis Nutricula. 

Science had to come up with a solution, because eventually there would be nothing except children left to take care of the worlds problems, and that would be a disaster. So after long years of searching, and developing, and many more years of testing they finally had a solution. It was derived from the leaves of the sacred lotus plant, and it was called the Lotus Solution. No one knew why it worked. It just did. 

They had to figure a way to dispense the drug, because they knew not everyone wanted to take it, so they came up with a plan. That plan was to put it in the worlds water supply. Well, after around a year, the drug was in the water supply. Then as people drank the water, they stopped going into a coma at 85, and might live for another 5-10 years before they would die. Even though it was a failed science experiment, there was a lot scientists learned like not to play with nature",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
