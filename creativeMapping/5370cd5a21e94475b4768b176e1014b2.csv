 We have a situation. The one you have to reach is a man named Mike. He was a good man, raised by two wonderful parents. They died in a car accident when he was 19, and that's when everything went wrong for Mike.""

""He got into drugs, and was homeless. He joined the marines right before he turned 21, and he fought his way to Iraq. There, he saw his friends being blown to pieces by IEDs and suicide bombers. He was susceptible to demons, and they possessed him. The last thing he remembers is seeing his friend's brains splatter against the wall of a house in Fallujah. He woke up in a hotel room with his friend's blood on his hands, and no memory of what happened to him. Mike has an item we need to stop further demonic possession. But we can't find out where he hid it, until we exorcise him. ""
