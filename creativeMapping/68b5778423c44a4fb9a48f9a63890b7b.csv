It turns out you could have taken the drug. You could have avoided aging, for all of these past years. ou could have been immortal.
 At 85, you are tired. You no longer have the energy to consider all of the options of a younger person. All of the things that you could have done seem so far in the past. You don't want to stop the aging process now. It's too late to live forever.
