Barring any accidents or new diseases, that science hasn't learned how to treat effectively, you could basically live forever. But, you've already seen your grandchildren grow up. They are already taking the anti-aging drug. You just can't know if it's worth doing it all, over again, from the point of view of a tired, 85 year old man.

You don't want to extend your life, only out of fear. You don't want to end it out of fear either. You want this decision to be based on what has happened and what could still happen, from a hopeful perspective. You just can't know if it's realistic to look forward to a bright future. It's all a gamble, and you just don't know if you want to ante up again. It's a very difficult decision.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

It turns out you could have taken the drug. You could have avoided aging, for all of these past years. ou could have been immortal.
 At 85, you are tired. You no longer have the energy to consider all of the options of a younger person. All of the things that you could have done seem so far in the past. You don't want to stop the aging process now. It's too late to live forever.

You don't want to extend your life, only out of fear. You don't want to end it out of fear either. You want this decision to be based on what has happened and what could still happen, from a hopeful perspective. You just can't know if it's realistic to look forward to a bright future. It's all a gamble, and you just don't know if you want to ante up again. It's a very difficult decision.
