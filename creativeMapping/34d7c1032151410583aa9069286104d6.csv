A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere.

A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere. They felt that the world was fine without America, and what happened there was of no concern to the global community.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere. They felt that the world was fine without America, and what happened there was of no concern to the global community.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere. They felt that the world was fine without America, and what happened there was of no concern to the global community.

This was a mistake. The Second Civil War raged out of control, eventually leading to the deployment of nuclear weapons, and the US became a nuclear wasteland. Far from being unaffected, the rest of the world suffered from the ensuing nuclear winter, and all the progress that humanity had made was swiftly erased.

The planet was clean, global warming had been reversed, and even the poorest countries were developing like never before, in a manner that benefited both human prosperity, and the planet's ecosystems.

In short, the world was a better place without the United States.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere. They felt that the world was fine without America, and what happened there was of no concern to the global community.

This was a mistake. The Second Civil War raged out of control, eventually leading to the deployment of nuclear weapons, and the US became a nuclear wasteland.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere. They felt that the world was fine without America, and what happened there was of no concern to the global community.

This was a mistake. The Second Civil War raged out of control, eventually leading to the deployment of nuclear weapons, and the US became a nuclear wasteland. Far from being unaffected, the rest of the world suffered from the ensuing nuclear winter, and all the progress that humanity had made was swiftly erased.
