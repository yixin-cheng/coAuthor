You get in contact with your friends who are still alive and decide to tour the globe. Okay, that plan is rapidly discarded when you realize you don't really want to fly with a pilot who is well over 80. You all make a change, and decide to tour the US. You rent a bus and take off.

The first stop is Las Vegas. Thankfully, when the people who had taken the medication died off, their bodies also decomposed rapidly and disappeared. It was reminiscent of the movie 'Old."" In Vegas, you stay at the best hotels and win at every casino you go to. The next stop, is Hollywood. You spend a week there, seeing all the sights and visiting all the famous movie sets. The journey with your friends continues over the next several years. Always somewhere new and always a ton of fun and excitement. The problem is, as you get old, too much excitement isn't a good thing. You start to get sick.

There are no longer any practicing doctors left in the country, so there is no one to really help you get better. You are on your own. You leave your friends and decide to visit the one place you loved to go when you were younger. Mount Rainer. You've always loved the snow and the cold. You get there and it's just as beautiful as you remember. You hike up the mountain and find a nice spot to sit and enjoy the view. You feel so peaceful and happy.

text-insert,"When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.  The side effects are horrendous. The medication causes rapid aging in all of those that had previously been 'cured.' Everyone who had taken the drug grows older to the age they would eventually have died at, in one day. The world is thrown into chaos as the elderly die off in droves.  

In a matter of weeks, the only people left on the planet are the elderly, of which you are a member. Anyone who was young is gone. Including  infants and children. It seemed that the drug was only stable for a short amount of time. When it destabilized everyone who had received it pretty much fizzled out. You are in complete despair. The world seems so empty and lonely with nothing but old people walking around looking sad. 

You are one of the lucky ones, you suddenly realize. You are still alive and have a chance to do anything and everything you wish to do. You are no longer the 'Lost Generation.' You are a member of the Only Generation. The thought is freeing and exhilarating.  You have the world at your fingertips. You are free to do whatever you want with the time you have left. You get in contact with your friends who are still alive and decide to tour the globe.
