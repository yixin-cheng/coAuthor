Out of it came the alien, with Matt Damon alongside him. ""I am being abducted, I think!"" Matt Damon said. But this made no sense. If he was being abducted, then why didn't the alien just take him? ""What do you want from us?"" one of the FBI agents asked the alien.

 ""I think I saw an alien just yesterday,""he told the FBI over the phone. It was in the woods behind my house. No one believed me but I think I saw a UFO. It was a big, black ship,""Steven Spielberg said. 

So the FBI searched behind Spielberg's house for the big black ship or the alien. Finally someone saw the ship. The FBI surrounded it and knocked on the door. Out of it came the alien, with Matt Damon alongside him. ""I am being abducted, I think!"" Matt Damon said. But this made no sense. If he was being abducted, then why didn't the alien just take him? ""What do you want from us?"" one of the FBI agents asked the alien. 
""I want you to make a movie about this.!"" the alien said. Just then, Spielberg approached. ""I'll make your movie!"" said Spielberg. ""Just release Matt Damon and I'll make a movie about you!""

Out of it came the alien, with Matt Damon alongside him. ""I am being abducted, I think!"" Matt Damon said. But this made no sense. If he was being abducted, then why didn't the alien just take him?
