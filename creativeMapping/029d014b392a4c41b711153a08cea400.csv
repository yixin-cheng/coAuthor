 He was truly flabbergasted at the site of it and knew there was no way he could blow it down like the others. So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" he wolf totally didn't know what to make of this house.
 He was truly flabbergasted at the site of it and knew there was no way he could blow it down like the others. So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf.

He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf. 

The wolf would be killed finally on that day by the smartest pig among them. Pig number 92 would live on as the champion of pigville. he story of Pig number 92 was written by a famous piggy poet.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" he wolf totally didn't know what to make of this house.
 He was truly flabbergasted at the site of it and knew there was no way he could blow it down like the others. So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf. 

The wolf would be killed finally on that day by the smartest pig among them. Pig number 92 would live on as the champion of pigville. he story of Pig number 92 was written by a famous piggy poet.

So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf. 

The wolf would be killed finally on that day by the smartest pig among them. Pig number 92 would live on as the champion of pigville. he story of Pig number 92 was written by a famous piggy poet.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" he wolf totally didn't know what to make of this house.
 He was truly flabbergasted at the site of it and knew there was no way he could blow it down like the others. So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf. 

The wolf would be killed finally on that day by the smartest pig among them. Pig number 92 would live on as the champion of pigville. he story of Pig number 92 was written by a famous piggy poet.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" he wolf totally didn't know what to make of this house.
 He was truly flabbergasted at the site of it and knew there was no way he could blow it down like the others. So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf. 

The wolf would be killed finally on that day by the smartest pig among them. Pig number 92 would live on as the champion of pigville. he story of Pig number 92 was written by a famous piggy poet.

1442,suggestion-get,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" he wolf totally didn't know what to make of this house.
 He was truly flabbergasted at the site of it and knew there was no way he could blow it down like the others. So he decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after three months of sitting there the little pig came out. Finally, the wolf could strike and get his meaty little morsel into his stomach. He hid in the bushes and waited for the pig to walk by. The little pig came out, looked around, and went right back into the house. The wolf could not believe it! He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. 

The wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. 
he wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher.
 He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf.
