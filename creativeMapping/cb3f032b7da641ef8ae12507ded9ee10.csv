So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that house does not stand a chance against my blowing abilities. The little pig laughed and closed the window and sat to read a book. Outside the wolf was blowing away at the house with no movement at all. he wolf was like, ""this is not working."", so he tried to set it on fire but it would not burn, he then tried to ram it with some boulders but the uranium was too strong. The wolf was like, ""I am going to have to use my secret weapon."" The wolf applied for a student loan and went to college for 12 years, getting his phd in nuclear physics. He then invented a device that would instantly turn uranium 238 into the explosive 235. 
After 12 long years, the wolf returned to the little pig's uranim home and gave the piggy one last chance to come out on his own. The pig laughed again, closed the window and took a nap. The wolf then set up his device right outside the house, pressed the big red button and shot a huge ray of energy straight at the house. The house started to glow green and vibrate.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that house does not stand a chance against my blowing abilities. The little pig laughed and closed the window and sat to read a book. Outside the wolf was blowing away at the house with no movement at all. he wolf was like, ""this is not working."", so he tried to set it on fire but it would not burn, he then tried to ram it with some boulders but the uranium was too strong. The wolf was like, ""I am going to have to use my secret weapon."" The wolf applied for a student loan and went to college for 12 years, getting his phd in nuclear physics. He then invented a device that would instantly turn uranium 238 into the explosive 235. 
After 12 long years, the wolf returned to the little pig's uranim home and gave the piggy one last chance to come out on his own. The pig laughed again, closed the window and took a nap. The wolf then set up his device right outside the house, pressed the big red button and shot a huge ray of energy straight at the house. The house started to glow green and vibrate. The little piggy awoke to what felt like a magnatude 9 earthquake. He ran back and forth through the house burning his little feet as he ran. The wolf was laughing and laughing as he watched the house shake and vibrate. Then the worst case scenario happened, the house exploaded with the force of 1500 Hiroshima size bombs.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that house does not stand a chance against my blowing abilities. The little pig laughed and closed the window and sat to read a book. Outside the wolf was blowing away at the house with no movement at all. he wolf was like, ""this is not working."", so he tried to set it on fire but it would not burn, he then tried to ram it with some boulders but the uranium was too strong. The wolf was like, ""I am going to have to use my secret weapon."" The wolf applied for a student loan and went to college for 12 years, getting his phd in nuclear physics. He then invented a device that would instantly turn uranium 238 into the explosive 235. 
After 12 long years, the wolf returned to the little pig's uranium home and gave the piggy one last chance to come out on his own. The pig laughed again, closed the window and took a nap. The wolf then set up his device right outside the house, pressed the big red button and shot a huge ray of energy straight at the house. The house started to glow green and vibrate. The little piggy awoke to what felt like a magnatude 9 earthquake. He ran back and forth through the house burning his little feet as he ran. The wolf was laughing and laughing as he watched the house shake and vibrate. Then the worst case scenario happened, the house exploaded with the force of 1500 Hiroshima size bombs. It obliterated the whole continent and every living being on it, except for the wolf who was shielded by the ray of energy the machine produced.
