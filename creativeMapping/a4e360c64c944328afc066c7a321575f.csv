""After the movie is over, you'll have two hours to edit it.

The film you are watching is your life, and you are watching it from the moment you are born until the moment you die.
  Your mind is a clean slate as you watch the movie.  Everything you see is unknown.  But you also start to realize that you don't remember any of your other lives.  So why are you seeing this? This is your next life and if it's a movie, it must mean that you can't do anything about it.

""After the movie is over, you'll have two hours to edit it.  They were supposed to tell you that before the movie started, but the folks running the Reincarnation Division have gotten lazy over the last few years.
