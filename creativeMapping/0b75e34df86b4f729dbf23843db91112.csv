 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve.

These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions.

Barack immediately recognized JFK's voice on the other end of the line.
 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was  by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work. You must follow through with what he has started. ",user,20,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" Barack was both confused and excited. He heard rumors about old or dead presidents being seen in top secret reports but never paid much attention to them. After talking with Michelle, he got the go ahead and called the number. A foul mouthed lady answered the phone and immediately put him on hold. After 20 mins she returned and loudly asked for his name. Hold on a minute she says and transfers the call. 
Barack immediately recognized JFK's voice on the other end of the line.
 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

Barack immediately recognized JFK's voice on the other end of the line.
 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK."" Barack was both confused and excited. He heard rumors about old or dead presidents being seen in top secret reports but never paid much attention to them. After talking with Michelle, he got the go ahead and called the number. A foul mouthed lady answered the phone and immediately put him on hold. After 20 mins she returned and loudly asked for his name. Hold on a minute she says and transfers the call. 
Barack immediately recognized JFK's voice on the other end of the line.
 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve.

These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto.

Barack immediately recognized JFK's voice on the other end of the line.
 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.
