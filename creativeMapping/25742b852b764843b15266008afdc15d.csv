  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""

  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.


You spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""

You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.


You spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.

  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?

You reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something wunexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  

You look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?

  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""

  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.

You reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something wunexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  

You look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!  

You try to shake it off, and pretend that you were just hearing things, but as you pull out your keys, you see a large, dead bee stuck to the key ring.

You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.


You spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.

You head back to the bike rack, find your bicycle chained up where you left it, and crouch down.
You reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something wunexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  

You look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!  

You try to shake it off, and pretend that you were just hearing things, but as you pull out your keys, you see a large, dead bee stuck to the key ring.

""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""

""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""

You reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something wunexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  

You look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!  

You try to shake it off, and pretend that you were just hearing things, but as you pull out your keys, you see a large, dead bee stuck to the key ring.

Nervously, you manage to stutter out, ""Your majes",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""
You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.

Nervously, you manage to stutter out, ""Your majesty, I presum",user,38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""
You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.


You spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.  
As the sun sets, you mdecide to ake your way back home.

text-insert,"Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""
You order the bee to get off you, and it does so.
  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.


You spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.  
As the sun sets, you mdecide to ake your way back home.
  

You head back to the bike rack, find your bicycle chained up where you left it, and crouch down.
You reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something wunexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  

You look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!

  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.

""I'll stay off your shoulder,"" she says.  ""What, may I ask, are your orders?""
There is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.
  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  

If one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?
What do you say to her?
  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  

""Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?"" you ask?
""I know they will,"" she responds.


""Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm""
""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.
  It is too far for us to fly on our own""
""Then how far can you go?""


""We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves""
""Then I order you to go there..  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry""
You have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.


For the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.

You can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  ou've never felt better in your life.


You spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.  
As the sun sets, you mdecide to ake your way back home.
  

You head back to the bike rack, find your bicycle chained up where you left it, and crouch down.
You reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something wunexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  

You look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!  

You try to shake it off, and pretend that you were just hearing things, but as you pull out your keys, you see a large, dead bee stuck to the key ring.
