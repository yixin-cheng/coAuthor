The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a

The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.

But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""

The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""

The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.

The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.

He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.

But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house.

The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird.""

The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird.""

He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast.

And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.

The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.

The wolf decided to try a different approach.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

The wolf decided to try a different approach.

But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator. It was a new day, and a new life for the 92nd little pig. For",user,34,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a
ny longer, spoke the 92nd little pig to the wolf"". And sure enough, they went into the comfort of their bed, wondering a bit if the wolf would break into their house, while they slumbered.

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator. It was a new day, and a new life for the 92nd little pig, and no wolf or threat could ever take that away from them",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
