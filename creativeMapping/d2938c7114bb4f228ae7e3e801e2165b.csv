This doesn't sway the PTA, however, who are more interested in bringing about the death of their hated rival. After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation. Unfortunately, the PTA's leader, a bitter and misguided father named Henry Tuttle, aka the Worst Dad has other plans. After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation. Unfortunately, the PTA's leader, a bitter and misguided father named Henry Tuttle, aka the Worst Dad has other plans. After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

However, a few embittered low-ranking dads form a terrorist group called ""PTA"" (People to Take Action) and begin to plot revenge against the actual Best Dad, which leads to an eventual plot to kill him.

In the meantime, the Best Dad has become the leader of a cult-like organization, the Dad Council, that rapidly grows in power and influence.

After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation.

After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation.

After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation.

The second, is that the actual ""Best Dad"" in the world becomes a figure of worldwide attention and worship, as dads try to gain his favor in a variety of ways, hoping to increase their dad ranking. However, a few embittered low-ranking dads form a terrorist group called ""PTA"" (People to Take Action) and begin to plot revenge against the actual Best Dad, which leads to an eventual plot to kill him.

In the meantime, the Best Dad has become the leader of a cult-like organization, the Dad Council, that rapidly grows in power and influence. Their aims are benign though, since they seek to bring about world peace by encouraging fathers to spend more time with their families, and as a side-effect of having more time with their families, the families become more well-adjusted, stable, and productive. This doesn't sway the PTA, however, who are more interested in bringing about the death of their hated rival. After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation. Unfortunately, the PTA's leader, a bitter and misguided father named Henry Tuttle, aka the Worst Dad has other plans. After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

Their aims are benign though, since they seek to bring about world peace by encouraging fathers to spend more time with their families, and as a side-effect of having more time with their families, the families become more well-adjusted, stable, and productive.

After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation.

After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

Their aims are benign though, since they seek to bring about world peace by encouraging fathers to spend more time with their families, and as a side-effect of having more time with their families, the families become more well-adjusted, stable, and productive. This doesn't sway the PTA, however, who are more interested in bringing about the death of their hated rival. After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation.

After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

In the meantime, the Best Dad has become the leader of a cult-like organization, the Dad Council, that rapidly grows in power and influence. Their aims are benign though, since they seek to bring about world peace by encouraging fathers to spend more time with their families, and as a side-effect of having more time with their families, the families become more well-adjusted, stable, and productive. This doesn't sway the PTA, however, who are more interested in bringing about the death of their hated rival. After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation. Unfortunately, the PTA's leader, a bitter and misguided father named Henry Tuttle, aka the Worst Dad has other plans. After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

However, a few embittered low-ranking dads form a terrorist group called ""PTA"" (People to Take Action) and begin to plot revenge against the actual Best Dad, which leads to an eventual plot to kill him.

In the meantime, the Best Dad has become the leader of a cult-like organization, the Dad Council, that rapidly grows in power and influence. Their aims are benign though, since they seek to bring about world peace by encouraging fathers to spend more time with their families, and as a side-effect of having more time with their families, the families become more well-adjusted, stable, and productive. This doesn't sway the PTA, however, who are more interested in bringing about the death of their hated rival. After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation. Unfortunately, the PTA's leader, a bitter and misguided father named Henry Tuttle, aka the Worst Dad has other plans. After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

As he lies in intensive care, the members of the Dad Council begin bickering amongst themselves, leading to a power struggle for control of the Dad Council. In the ensuing chaos, they neglect their families and all their Dad rankings, as revealed by the mugs, drop precipitously. Eventually, every mug breaks, leading to a tenuous return to peace, and humanity timidly moves forward to try to rebuild having barely survived this strange situatio",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
